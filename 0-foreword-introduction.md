### **Foreword**

So here's the thing: I don't like to talk very much. That's kind of why I started playing drums in the first place.

Back in high school, I didn't even want to answer a question from a teacher because it made me so uncomfortable. Putting myself on the record has always felt intimidating. When me and Tyler first started doing interviews, I often felt anxious. I never wanted to say the wrong thing, especially when what I said would begin being shared with thousands of people all over the world.

What I also found difficult was the volume of conversations: sometimes a dozen or more in a single day.

It was a steep learning curve for both of us. We had to figure out what each person wanted from us - when to be serious, when we could be silly or light-hearted - and every interviewer was different.

Speaking with Ryan, who wrote the book you're holding now, has always felt particularly comfortable. In the beginning, being me, I found myself trying to second-guess a lot - condensing my answers so that he didn't have as much to transcribe! I almost felt guilty about saying too much, or giving him too much work to do.

Over time, though, I began to see how he interpreted things and became familiar with the way that he wrote.

It started to feel really cool, not to mention flattering. His interview style is so conversational, leaving just enough room for us to respond in a calm and considered way.

He's made it easy for us to communicate over the years, and I can always see the direction that he wants a story to go in.

Crucially, I always trust his intentions.

That's where this book comes in. Our relationship with Ryan has been so organic, and it continues to grow and evolve today. I want to preserve the story we've been telling together for almost a decade, and having all of our conversations together in one place feels special.

I often think about how much information he has passed on to people, and how many pivotal moments in our lives he has captured and preserved. If he hadn't done that, I don't know how we would have kept them alive.

There are some deeply intimate conversations captured within these pages, and as you make your way through this book, I hope you begin to feel as though you're a part of them.

Most of all, I hope they give you an even better understanding of not just how Tyler and I feel, but of who we truly are.

"WELL, IF THERE isn't anybody else..."

Those six words have stayed with me since they were uttered more than nine years ago.

It was February of 2015, and as Editor, I had just decided to put a band on the cover of Rock Sound magazine for the very first time. As almost anyone who has worked in the music media will tell you, a band or artist receiving its first magazine cover is often something people can see coming a mile off - an inevitable coronation based on the notion of when rather than if.

This time, however, was different. Not only would this be the band in question's first magazine cover outside of their native United States, but it would also be one of their first features in any overseas publication, full stop.

It was a moment I had been building up to since I first saw the band at my local music venue, England's Oxford Academy II. In front of a mere 400 people on a cold and predictably miserable night - the evening of February 18, 2014, to be exact - I witnessed what remains one of the most remarkable and stunning spectacles I have ever set eyes on.

For just over an hour, two men, armed with nothing more than a drum kit, a piano, and, to my utter bemusement, a ukulele, put on one of the most enthralling performances I had ever seen. From the moment the pair burst into life, with their faces concealed by balaclavas, what subsequently unfolded on a cramped and tiny stage - the very stage that Radiohead had filmed the music video to their breakthrough-hit-turned-outcast-anthem 'Creep' on more than two decades earlier - was both unique and, in all honesty, unbelievable.

It wasn't merely the music, which appeared to have such little regard for borders and boundaries that it would make the veins of anyone who has ever obsessed over the existence of small boats or the building of walls positively explode, that stood out. Mainly, it was the reaction of the people present.

Their people.

For the duration of the set, it was as though every song performed was the most famous song in the world.

In reality, there was not a single mainstream hit, let alone many, meaning there was no logical reason as to why every person in the room seemed to know every word to every song, let alone felt the need to scream the words as though it was the last show they would ever witness.

From the first minute to the last, that was what happened, and in the months and years to come, I would learn that such a response was very much the rule rather than the exception. It wasn't just that night, it was every night, in every town, in every country. Though the world has since caught up, at that time the only people aware of the phenomenon were those already in the room.

Turning to a young woman next to me, I asked her if she believed that the band in question - Twenty One Pilots - could one day become one of the biggest bands in the world.

Without any hesitation, she delivered one of the sharpest and most brilliant answers to any question I've ever heard:

"They're going to be the only band in the world." Those words made the ones at the beginning of this introduction seem outrageous. Having proudly declared my intentions to place the band on the front cover to a fellow member of the music press, their response - one that implied such a decision could only have been made due to a lack of other options - served only to prove that much of the planet was still asleep.

At that moment, I realised that if I was the only person in my tiny corner of the world who believed that the band had a story worth telling, it was one that 1 wanted to tell myself.

Make no mistake: whether or not I or anybody had written a single word about Twenty One Pilots, it would not have hindered their success. However, I will always be proud that while plenty of other outlets were begrudgingly giving them minimal attention, if any, while openly pondering whether they were a threat to rock and alternative culture, mine had the guts to scream that they were its future from its front page.

To steal a turn of phrase: they were the only choice.

In the years since our first conversation, I've been fortunate enough to have been granted permission to document tiny chapters of the band's story more frequently than anybody else. From being given a front-row seat as their incredible, once-in-a-lifetime rise unfolded following the release of Blurryface, to being flown to their hometown of Columbus, Ohio for an exclusive first interview ahead of the release of Trench, the trust and the belief shown in me by not only Tyler and Josh, but by their entire inner circle has been one of the most humbling experiences of my career.

All things told, I am proud to say that I placed them on the cover of Rock Sound on eight separate occasions over the course of my time there. Since we met, they have allowed me to meet and spend time with their families (Hi, Bill!) just as they have been gracious enough to spend time with my own, and have on occasion invited me into their homes as well as their dressing rooms.

Be it recording a song in the form of their stunning re-imagining of My Chemical Romance's 'Cancer, or embracing me on the day that I watched my brother pass away from that very disease, the decency and respect that I have been shown by the band's camp, not just professionally but also personally, is something that I will always be hugely grateful for.

More than friendship and opportunity, they have provided me with something that I have not encountered enough of in my life: genuine inspiration.

It's something I've found not only in their music, their message, and their methods, but in those they bring together. If you're reading these words, you are almost certainly one of the people I speak of. From Birmingham to Brussels, Manchester to Manhattan, and Copenhagen to Chicago, for nearly a decade, I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the love and dedication that people from all over the world afford them. I've sat on trains and buses in the early hours of numerous mornings, listening to people relive every moment of concerts that gave them hope and purpose.

I've walked lines on multiple continents and witnessed friendships being made in real-time, born of a shared love and passion for music and the individuals who make it. I've even seen that passion shake buildings to their foundations, to the extent that they have needed to close in order to be physically and structurally repaired.

It's because of that power, and therefore because of people like you, that this book - this collection of stories and conversations - exists.

Let me be clear that when it comes to Twenty One Pilots, the book that you are holding in your hands is merely a book, rather than the book. If and when that book exists, it will belong to Tyler and Josh and will be presented on their terms, in their own words. This is merely a collection of stories I have been lucky enough to have written myself, all of which stand tall as the works I am most proud to have produced.

In a typical act of kindness and generosity, it's also presented with some fresh and exclusive input from Tyler and Josh themselves. Two men I believe to be at the centre of a remarkable tale that is going to continue being written, and hopefully written about, for many years to come.

I don't view these as my stories, but as our stories. As such, that means they're your stories.

Though I would never speak on their behalf, I feel comfortable in stating that for as long as I have known them, Tyler and Josh have been constantly in awe of the support that has been shown to them by their fans at every turn. Our conversations have been dominated not by the idleness of gossip or the intricacies of building worlds, but by why it is that they do what they do, as well as what it is that inspires them to do it:

You.

With that said - thank you.

Thank you for drawing my attention to one of the most exciting, vital bands in the world.

Thank you for your passion, and for helping to create and inspire what I believe to be one of the most intriguing, important musical and cultural movements of our time.

Thank you for insisting these stories were written in the first place, as well as ensuring they will continue to live on in some small, albeit hopefully meaningful way.

Most of all, thank you for proving to the entire world that, no matter what anyone may have once thought, there really isn't anybody else.
