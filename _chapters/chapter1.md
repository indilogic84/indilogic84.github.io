### **Chapter 1: Leaders of The New World Order **

FIVE. MORE. YEARS.

On a warm but breezy day in mid-May, those words are reverberating around millions of homes, pubs and offices across the United Kingdom.

Days after a general election that saw fear win out over hope, you can feel the despair in the wind. While a tangible sense of dread looms, there remains the smallest glimmer of hope that something better might soon come along. Something, or perhaps someone, with the power to galvanise the masses like few before them.

Inside an east London warehouse, on this afternoon, two men with change on their minds stand side by side.

As thick red smoke bellows out of a nearby grenade, one sits dutifully at an old piano and begins playing a series of sombre, sporadic notes. As he does this, the other pulls the cap from a distress flare and raises it defiantly into the air. Its blinding red light fills the room, emitting a level of heat that causes everybody in the immediate vicinity to cover their eyes and take several steps back.

While the timing of this display might seem fitting, the pair come not in the name of political reform but reform of a different, albeit equally meaningful kind.

Help, it seems, is on the way.

"The beauty of music is that it has absolutely no limits," offers Tyler Joseph, one of the building's resident anarchists. "There are no rules - no laws. It's like the ultimate playground. No matter how old you get, you're always allowed to play on it."

Flanked today by his friend and Twenty One Pilots bandmate Josh Dun, Tyler has spent the last six years breaking just about every musical convention presently enshrined in law. With Josh on drums and Tyler on vocals, piano, ukulele and pretty much any other instrument you can fit on a stage, the pair's unique blend of rap, hip-hop, electronica, rock and off-kilter pop has seen them become an underground phenomenon. Lauded by their peers and adored by an army of fans that appears to be multiplying by the day, these two 26-year-old men could soon be so much more than that.

In all honesty, they could be about to become arguably the most important band of the decade.

Best of all? They're virtually oblivious to such a fact.

"I've always felt behind in some ways," confesses Tyler. "I didn't play my first show until I was 19. More and more people of that age are already signed or putting out records, or touring 200 days out of the year, so it was a pretty late start. Even now, I still feel like I'm trying to catch up."

If the frontman is still trying to catch up, then there's not much point in anybody else bothering to start running. As the pair arrive shortly after 10 am, they do so with a UK tour taking place in six months already completely sold out, with tickets having gone on sale at almost the exact moment they make their entrance for today's photo shoot. More than 2,000 tickets in London; 1,500 tickets in Manchester; 1,000 tickets in Glasgow - gone in seconds. And that's not even all of them.

Similarly, their North American headline tour due to take place in September and October of this year is sold out in almost every city already, racking up sales of well over 100,000 tickets. They won't know it for several more weeks, but their new album Blurryface is about to top the album charts in their homeland, turning every head from Los Angeles to New York firmly in their direction. They have achieved this with virtually no press, no mainstream radio play, and most strikingly of all, no regard for how things are 'supposed' to be done.

It shouldn't have happened, but it did, and it is. While that fact might seem like the body, in truth it's merely the headline.

Believe me when I say this: the story is just beginning.

---

It's a story that can be traced back to Columbus, the state capital and largest city of Ohio. Situated in the heart of the American Midwest, the state is often (albeit wrongly) associated with grey, gloomy skies that hang wearily over a rusting and increasingly hopeless landscape. It's the type of place some spend their entire youth dreaming of escaping. Against all odds, it was there that the seeds of one of the most colourful bands in existence were planted. Seeds that are now beginning to bloom.

"Some of the best times in my life stem from when I was a kid growing up in Columbus," smiles Tyler.

"Yesterday it started raining, and the smell took me back to when my brother and I would sit [in our house! and wait for it to stop so that we could go outside and play. I loved that part of my life. I write a lot of songs about things like that - not necessarily to hold on to those memories but to try to recreate them.

"Even though I get to travel the world," he whispers,

"Columbus is still my favourite city on Earth."

For Tyler, Columbus isn't just home. In truth, it was the only place he'd ever known for much of his life.

Growing up in a family that rarely travelled - both of his parents were teachers who earned fairly modest incomes - family vacations were often about sleeping in and staying home rather than exploring the big, wide world.

"In the last two years I've seen more of the world than I ever imagined," he marvels. "Prior to being in this band, I had probably been on a plane twice in my entire life. I would love for my family to be able to see and experience what I do. The world is so much bigger than I thought."

Although both members of Twenty One Pilots were born and raised in the city ("I lived in two houses before the age of 25, and they were less than three miles apart," says Josh) only Tyler remains at present, with Josh relocating to Los Angeles last year. Despite the two places being a good 2,000 miles apart, Josh estimates that he spends as much time in Columbus as he does in the city he calls home, if you can ever really call Los Angeles that.

"Home is a weird concept to me," he offers. "I feel like I have a house full of stuff, which is completely different. The idea of a home seems kind of foreign [to me] these days. For me, home is pretty much wherever I'm hanging out with Tyler!

"That said," he continues, "I honestly don't know whether I could ever have moved away unless Tyler was still in Columbus."

His bandmate seems genuinely taken aback by this.

"Really?"

"Really. I moved away knowing that because Tyler is still in Columbus, I'll still be there a lot. As long as Tyler is there, it feels like I'll always have that connection."

This might sound sweet - and it undoubtedly is - but it would be easy to get lost in the sentiment and completely overlook how completely alien such a fondness and pride in their city of birth can be in the modern era.

In the world of rock in particular, the biographies and memoirs of countless stars and icons are littered with tales of struggle, as well as a deep desperation, to escape towns and birthplaces that, more often than not, they consider prisons.

Twenty One Pilots choose not to shy away from the place they call home, but to instead put it at the centre of everything they do.

Earlier this year, the pair celebrated Record Store Day by releasing a vinyl in the shape of Ohio, while the video for recent single "Stressed Out' sees them sitting on curbs and pedalling children's tricycles around the very streets they grew up on, performing in their real-life childhood homes as their families look on.

"In a way, I suppose we're trying to bring both our families and hometown along with us," explains Tyler.

"Maybe part of that is the guilt, or the regret that in doing what we do, we miss out on a lot of really important things. Relationships can start to change [because of that absence], and I don't like that. I think that both of us feel like we could be better brothers and better sons.

"Columbus isn't just where we're from - it's where everything about this band started," he continues.

"Those are two very different but equally important things to me. So many bands move away from where they're from in order to try to make it, but Josh and I didn't want to do that. We wanted to make it happen in Ohio, and that's exactly what we did. Even if you've never been there, if you're a fan of our band then that love was born out of there.

"This band is Columbus."

It's both their hometown and their native state to which the two men owe much of their success. In their collective infancy, the pair would drive an hour or two outside of Columbus to perform, gradually building an audience with the goal of enticing them to later attend shows in Columbus itself, sucking people in as though they were satellites caught in orbit.

The plan worked, and after playing a hometown show to some 1,800 people in late 2011, the two signed with Atlantic Records subsidiary Fueled By Ramen to release their major label debut, Vessel, in January of 2013. In the two-and-a-bit years since its release, the album has gone on to shift more than 250,000 units in the United States alone, consistently selling more than 2,000 copies per week ever since. It's a platform from which they continue to benefit, and one that serves as an example of how, rather than chasing success, it is possible to bring it to your doorstep, on your own terms.

"I grew up with so many people who were like, I can't wait to finish school and get out of [this place],'" says Josh. "That always seemed so strange to me. If you feel like [going to] a particular place will be good for you, then by all means follow your heart, but I truly believe that you can achieve your goals no matter where you're from.

"Whenever I'm in Los Angeles, I see so many servers or waiters in restaurants who are working that job purely because they feel like they need to be in that city to meet their aspirations, and that makes me sad. I wish that they could build that foundation wherever it is that they're from. It sucks that people [feel like they] have to do that."

On paper, Tyler and Josh have stumbled upon a formula that works on a pretty remarkable scale. Taking top spot on any album chart is a real achievement, but to do so with over 130,000 units sold in a single week, as Blurryface is about to do, is genuinely staggering.

On British soil, the album will soon enter the charts at number 14, three places higher than Black Veil Brides' self-titled effort last October, and with a fraction of the media attention.

It's a big deal, especially when you consider that despite the eclectic, staunchly non-traditional rock sound in which they dabble, theirs is a fan base rooted firmly in the alternative world. Expanded via North American tours with the likes of Paramore, Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco and complimented by international festival slots at such rock-friendly festivals as Download and Reading & Leeds, they find themselves increasingly accepted by a culture that can often turn bands away for very little reason.

Such acceptance is testament not only to the band themselves, but to an increasingly diverse and open-minded community. After all, we currently live in a world where A Day To Remember and Taylor Swift mashups dominate social media feeds, where Katy Perry cut her teeth on Warped Tour, and where 5 Seconds Of

Summer play songs co-written with the likes of Joel and Benji Madden and Alex Gaskarth in front of tens of thousands of people every night, decked out in Sleeping With Sirens and Asking Alexandria shirts as they go.

The reality, as much as people might like to wish or pretend otherwise, is that in this day and age, the likes of Twenty One Pilots are becoming as relevant to rock culture as a band like Slayer.

Put that in your orange squash and drink it.

"Our philosophy is shared by a lot of people," offers Tyler, "and some of them happen to be into a certain type of music. It's hard to explain, but I think a lot of people respect the honesty of what we do. People know when you're real and when you're not, and I think they [can sense] that."

Beyond the music itself, there's a genuine and raw emotion fuelling their songs, thanks in no small part to Tyler's startlingly honest lyrics. Their songs resonate with people in a way not seen since My Chemical Romance gave a voice to the voiceless more than a decade ago, often addressing the many unspoken issues and insecurities that lurk within a surprising majority of people, regardless of age, gender, sexuality or social standing. Their concerns are universal yet too often downplayed or ignored.

"When I first started writing songs, I quickly realised that the words I was speaking within the music represented things that I could never bring up in regular conversation," Tyler explains. "The first time I ever showed anybody a song I had written, I couldn't believe I was letting them in on those thoughts and feelings. I expected people to hear it and be like, We need to have a serious talk about this, but for some reason, expressing those things through music seemed to make it okay. I was like, 'I'm actually getting away with this!'"

"I remember playing my parents a song I had written, which was me saying that I didn't know what I believed. That was a big deal - my parents had spent my life trying to influence those beliefs. I was sitting there, playing this song that expressed doubt, and they weren't trying to intervene. They simply thought it was a great song."

"I find it difficult to comprehend how many people take that freedom for granted," adds Josh. "In music, you have this perfect platform for freedom of expression, yet so many people choose not to exercise that. I think it would feel irresponsible were we not to use it."

As far as using that platform goes, the pair can never be accused of neglect, but what's most fascinating is their fans. Though unfathomably large in number, their genuine investment in the pair and their music is almost unparalleled. Such is the strength given to them by Tyler's words in particular that they frequently find the courage to overcome the most difficult aspects of everyday life, even directly involving the pair in the process.

On one occasion, during a signing in a record store, a young fan confessed that their music had helped them to come out as homosexual to their best friend. A best friend who was standing next to them at the time and looking somewhat... surprised. It quickly became apparent that this was the moment in question.

"It was definitely a weird [thing to witness]," says Josh, "but it was also incredibly touching. What's interesting about our band is that people want to respond to what it is we're saying. Whether it's writing a blog, sending us a letter, wanting to meet us, or even just meeting up and talking to each other, our music provokes people in a really positive and intimate way."

"I think about the effect that our music has on people a lot," adds Tyler. "It can be overwhelming. You have to try to not think about it too much. It can suffocate you." Of course, that's not to say that the notion of responsibility is something that either man wishes they were without. As well as meeting such pressures head-on, they actively encourage others to take ownership of their goals, along with the aspirations of the band. In the case of Blurryface, the pair refer to it not as our album but as 'your' album, putting direct ownership of the record and its songs into the hands of those who drove its creation, and in turn its emerging success.

To some, this method may seem little more than a clever marketing ploy, but when Tyler speaks about the responsibility that he feels in not only guiding, but respecting a potentially vulnerable audience, any such cynicism quickly goes out the window.

"When you talk about artists being role models or [setting] an example, a lot of people respond to that very negatively. Some people respond by saying, I didn't want that responsibility - that's not why I started making music. I don't want to be a role model. To me, that's the behaviour of somebody trying to avoid living their life correctly. That's not the way it works, and we do not shy away from our responsibilities. If we have a group of people who look up to us, then we are going to hold ourselves accountable.

"I don't like it when people don't accept that," he frowns. "That bothers me. It doesn't matter if you want it or not - the responsibility is yours. We will never, ever neglect that."

---

Whether you agree with them or not, be it regarding their philosophies personal or musical, one thing that nobody can take away from Twenty One Pilots is that theirs is a vision that is true to both them and their fans.

Considering the position that Blurryface has put them in and the success that it is currently enjoying via little more than word of mouth, they are not alone.

Their success is a perfect example of what it looks like to capture lighting in a bottle, though it's not what has happened that is most intriguing, but what's happening.

It's one thing storming the charts and playing to thousands of people every night, but it's another to do so in such an utterly uncompromising fashion. What's unfolding right now might seem like a triumphant conclusion, but in truth it's merely the opening chapter.

In a world where more and more unlikely candidates are rising through the ranks to headline arenas and scramble up festival bills, there is every reason to believe that one band could emerge to take it all.

It could be this one. Maybe it has to be this one.

The people, it seems, have spoken. The question now is: what is there left to fight for?

"It's really about trying to win," stresses Tyler. "When it comes to ambition, or whatever you want to call it, that's the thing that is always there. It's not about being competitive with the bands around us - that's not where the competition resides. It's about the doubt and the insecurity that we're fighting inside of ourselves every day, and it's a fight we want to win. We want to conquer our fears every night, and if those fears ever go away, that is when it ends.

"I watch bands in their third or fourth generation playing shows who look like they're having a good time, and I'm like, 'You didn't used to do it like this - you were wrestling something.' You could see the struggle in their eyes, and you could tell that their demons were present. Without that [struggle], there is no point to any of this.

"We've had conversations about making things easier," he continues. "We've talked about adding members to the live show - about whether we should write a smash hit pop song or change our image - and the answer has always been exactly the same."

"To change any of those things would be dangerous," adds Josh. "It's not easy doing this the way we're doing it, but I think it's what makes our success so rewarding and special. We don't always understand it, but this band is a movement that has become bigger than either of us ever imagined. The battle to do it on our terms is too essential a part of that to compromise now."

The struggle, as they say, is real, but it's a struggle that is positively vital to the mission at hand. As anyone who has ever fought for change will know, it's something that doesn't come easily or without sacrifice.

It takes blood, sweat and tears. It takes risking it all.

Change is a mission not for the weak of heart, but for those with a voice and the bravery to use it. It's for those with the courage to stand up and declare that they have had enough.

In 2015, the people willing to do that are perhaps more vital than ever. Without them, there is no future.

They are the ones who bring hope of a better world

They are the ones capable of leading the many.

They are the ones with the power to change everything.

They are invaluable, and they are here.

They are Twenty One Pilots, and this is your revolution.
