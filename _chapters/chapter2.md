## **Chapter 2: The Hitchhiker's Guide to Taking Over The Galaxy**

AT MIDDAY ON a cold and drizzly Sunday in November, the line forming outside Oxford Academy is rife with excitement and anticipation.

More than six hours before the venue doors will be allowedto swingopen, hundreds of people huddletogether under ponchos, blankets and sheets of plastic that will soon come in handy. Red beanie hats, backpacks fixed over both shoulders, and painted black hands are visible with every step. Rapid chatter and excitable squeals fill the air - the din punctuated only by the sound of skin slapping together as dozens of strangers use the time to perfect a handshake synonymous with its creators.

Later that afternoon, in the sanctuary of their small and ridiculously blue dressing room, Josh Dun and Tyler Joseph are talking about that same line. One that stretches as far as the eye can see and around the corner.

"The only time I have ever [waited in line] was a few years ago when I went to see Angels & Airwaves," says Josh. "I went with my girlfriend of the time, and she was really eager to arrive early. I didn't even know that [getting to a show early] was a thing people did! If I want a good spot at the show, I can probably push through to the front, but that day I got a totally different experience to the one I would have had if I'd showed up five minutes before [the band] went onstage. The feeling of the doors opening, getting inside, watching the opening act, and then the lights going down... it felt different.

"For the first time in my life, a band coming onstage genuinely felt like a moment."

In the six months since I last sat down with the pair, crowds like the one currently gathered outside this 1,000-capacity venue - the most modest of a UK tour already too modest by far - have become a daily occurrence. Those months have represented a period built on moments of their own, and of increasing importance. Sold-out shows across the planet; a chart-topping behemoth in latest album Blurryface; prime time television appearances; a jaw-dropping performance at the MTV Video Music Awards that saw them seated next to Kanye West - the list goes on.

In all honesty, in the time since we last met, Twenty One Pilots has become one of the fastest-growing, biggest-selling bands on the planet, bar none.

According to Tyler, such success is down solely to the people waiting in line.

"I'm really proud of what the people outside have created," he grins. "They might look at us and feel like we created this thing - this band, this community - but that's not the case. It's them coming together and creating this environment. They are the ones who make this what it is.'

He pauses, appearing genuinely in awe.

"This is all them."

Ten years ago, everything about today - both inside and outside these walls - was alien to Tyler. It wasn't until the age of 16 that the vocalist attended his first live music show. In front of a few dozen people at most ("A friend of a friend was playing - his name was Dave,"), what he saw that night would change his life.

"When you're a young kid who has never been to a show before, that experience is unlike anything you have ever known," he reminisces. "It's otherworldly.

I probably didn't look like I was having a great time from the performers' perspective, but my entire world changed [that night]. I had started playing around with music and writing songs, but I didn't know what those songs were for or where they were going to live. I didn't know how to get them out into the world, but that show gave me an answer.

"Seeing the stage was like an epiphany. I was like,

"That is where my music needs to go.'"

The venue that night was the Scarlet & Grey Cafe, a 300-capacity venue a stone's throw from the student housing complex of Ohio State University in the band's hometown of Columbus. Josh's first taste of live music was similarly humble, arriving in the form of a show at another Columbus venue, Skully's Music-Diner.

"I went to see a rapper because, obviously, I thought Eminem was the greatest thing ever at the time," smiles Josh. "The guy had a live band playing with him. That grabbed me, because a lot of rappers and hip-hop artists tended to use a DJ. It gave his performance a different dimension, especially visually.

"In the eighties and nineties, it was fine for people to just stand onstage and play. That was the age of the Rock God, when the people onstage seemed as though they were from another planet and were completely encapsulating without moving a muscle, but nowadays, it's really important to keep people engaged. That show played a huge part in shaping my opinion of what live music should ultimately be: an event."

If you have ever witnessed Twenty One Pilots in the flesh, you will know the word 'event' is more than a snug fit. A visual and sonic overload that sees both men playing their part in equal measure, their explosive live shows have propelled them into some of the world's biggest venues.

By the time you read this, the duo will be about to tackle two nights at London's 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy as part of a UK tour that takes in more than 30,000 people. When they return to their native United States, a mammoth summer-long trek will conclude with two landmark shows at New York City's famous Madison Square Garden - a venue that holds more than 20,000 people and often marks the pinnacle of any artist's career.

The pair sold the first night out in under three hours.

"We talk about our beginnings a lot in interviews," reflects Josh. "We talk about playing shows and having absolutely no idea how many people were going to show up. Sometimes it would be 30, and sometimes it would be 100 - we never really knew.

"To be in the position we're in now, where we know how many people are going to be there each night, is really cool. Seeing people on other continents, thousands of miles from home, being so invested in this band... we couldn't ask for anything more."

---

Of course, it wasn't always this way.

Ask the pair what the smallest number of people who ever attended a Twenty One Pilots show is, and they answer promptly and in perfect unison:

"Two."

"They were journalists from a student newspaper," laughs Josh. "We did an interview with them the day before the show, I think it was in Arkansas, and on the night, they were the only people (who showed up].

"It was weird, but I can honestly say that we played the show exactly as we would have had there been two thousand people there."

"There was another show like that," adds Tyler, "It was in Buffalo, New York and we played for just the other band on the bill. Technically, you could say there were five people there, but really there was no one.

Nobody paid to get in. That band really got the short end of the stick because when we watched them, they were only playing to two people, whereas we got to play to five!"

With the beauty of hindsight, it's easy to laugh and look back fondly on such occasions, but as anyone who has ever experienced life in a band at any level will tell you, such a genuine lack of interest in what you do can be a bitter, painful pill to swallow.

"It's difficult to look at hardly anybody turning up to see you play a show and feel encouraged," admits Tyler.

"It's not exactly something that makes you feel like you're progressing.

"I do know, though, that Josh and I could feel each other getting better every night," he continues. "We needed those shows and those moments to figure out who we are, both as a band and as performers. In a way, those shows ended up being some of my favourites, because if you're standing on stage in front of five people, you have an opportunity to blow those people away.

It's like, 'If I'm only going to play for a few people, Im going to blow their minds!

"I got excited knowing those people would be standing there feeling that everything we were about to do, we were doing just for them."

Is it harder to motivate yourselves for a show now?

"I'm inclined to say yes, but I want to be very clear about why," stresses Tyler. "Now and then it'll be approaching show time, and I'm feeling tired, sick, run down, or any combination of the above, and when I think back, I never used to feel any of those things. Not once did I ever feel those things when we were playing to a handful of people.

"I'm not saying I ever knowingly play a bad show or that I don't care about our performance, but it is different now, somehow. I feel things these days that I never felt when we were playing to five people."

What do you suppose the people who watched you back then think when they see you now?

"I actually met one [of those people] not long ago," reveals Josh. "A few years ago, we played a show in Indiana and stayed at this kid's house afterwards - I remember his basement, which was decked out in lots of Coca-Cola merchandise. A few weeks ago, I saw him at a show, and he was telling me how cool it's been to watch the band grow since then. There's a real sense of pride within people who saw us early on. It's almost like everybody from [those days] turned into a street team."

"There are a lot of people like that," adds Tyler.

"People who helped us and supported us, and who deserve to hang out with us and get into every show for free. Sometimes, I wish I could hit pause and take the time to thank them all.

"Right now, everything is going a million miles per hour. That can be difficult. Sometimes I feel bad because I want to give people more than I can."

During today's photo shoot, which takes place only a few feet away from a line of people who have no idea that the pair are so close they can hear them sneezing in the cold, it's easy to wonder who else Tyler feels he may be neglecting.

When asked to scribble destinations on pieces of cardboard, to mimic those held by hitchhikers as they look to reach wherever it is that they're going, Josh instinctively writes the words 'stage right'.

Tyler, curiously and after a long period of deliberation, chooses the word 'home?'

In the moment, the question mark feels even bigger than the stage behind him.

"I tend to be very compartmentalised with my relationships," he admits. "I put a lot of the people I care about in a box, so when I'm on the road, it's like, 'Let me just finish this and then I'll be back, and we can pretend like I was never gone.' It doesn't work that way, so I'm trying to get better at maintaining those connections while I'm away. Maybe it's a defence mechanism to stop myself from being bummed out about missing people.

"I probably just need to get over it."

Beyond the increasingly large number of people in attendance at their shows, everything about Twenty One Pilots is a far cry from where they were even a year ago, let alone several.

These days, the duo carry a crew of 14 people - a number that will rise significantly over the next year - and have traded splitter vans and shoebox motels for double-decker tour buses and comfortable hotel suites.

With last night's show at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire being barely an hour away by road, the band and much of the crew were able to spend the night in a well-known and distinctly not-too-shabby West London hotel, with the two bandmates arriving at today's venue by private car several hours after the rest of their party.

It's the sign of a band that, without wishing to sound crude, is probably doing quite well.

"One of the things I have always worried about as the crew grows is [our] dynamic with those people changing," says Tyler. "We keep the same crew for every tour. Our tour manager was the first person to drive us to a show in my dad's minivan, and he's still with us.

"It's cool because almost every person on our crew is doing their job for the first time. Bar one or two, no one in our crew has toured with any other band."

"There's a certain amount of ignorance to what we do that we quite enjoy," adds Josh, "so it suits us that the people around us don't know any better than we do. We have our own way of doing things, and so far, it seems to work. The last thing we need is somebody we might not even have anything in common with showing up and telling us that we're doing things wrong.

"If what we're doing is wrong, it feels pretty right." It's a fair point - typical of the single-mindedness with which the pair have always approached things.

In their earliest days together, the two would travel to shows in a vehicle owned by Tyler's father; its seats removed to make space for drums, lights, and all manner of weird and often homemade equipment. Alongside their day jobs, the pair would play almost exclusively at weekends, saving every penny possible to get to the next show. Eventually, much to the relief of Mr Joseph, they bought their own van.

"I still have it," smiles Tyler. "My buddy is borrowing it right now."

Taking each weekend as it came, they slowly but surely built not just a band but a self-sufficient and increasingly thriving business.

"It's a dirty word to some people, but you do have to treat certain aspects of being in a band the same as you would any other [business]," says Josh. "We knew a lot of bands back home who took out loans or borrowed money - bought equipment and vehicles and all that stuff - and then couldn't afford to pay it back.

"As a local band, playing shows beyond your neighbourhood is expensive. You need food, gas, hotels - that stuff isn't cheap."

"A lot of bands would spend all of their money touring across the country for a couple of months at a time, and that just didn't make sense to us," adds Tyler.

"That's one of the reasons we built this band entirely in Ohio - it was affordable. It never really added up for us to play a show to nobody, for no money, a thousand miles away.

"Yes, we did play a few shows like that, but we had a label supporting us, and they had a plan. It was an investment, and it was being made at the right time, for the right reasons. For every story like ours, thousands don't end quite so well."

Incredibly, the duo were still operating in this manner just three years ago, which, given their current success, feels legitimately outrageous.

"As much as things have started to blow up lover) these past few months, it feels like it's been a pretty slow climb to us," says Josh. "It doesn't feel like our success has just happened overnight."

"Everything we do builds on what we have done previously," nods Tyler. "It might seem as though we've just gone from A to B, but it's more like E to F. We're playing Brixton Academy in London, but that's going to be our fifth or sixth London headline show. We're playing Madison Square Garden in New York City, but that will be our fifth or sixth headliner there, too. We built this organically from the ground up, and we're seeing that hard work pay off.

"When you're touring as much as we are, it can desensitise you to what's going on," he continues. "We try to help each other - to make sure we don't become numb to what's happening. I like talking about our first show in New York, when we played to just the other band, because when you find yourself selling out Madison Square Garden [the journey] hits you. The present feels so much better when you take stock of the past."

As stage time arrives and the lights go down - a flip of the switch that sees those previously lining the streets experience a moment, just like the one Josh spoke of earlier in the day - it's the future rather than the past that takes centre stage.

Throughout their captivating 90-minute performance, three things become clear:

The first is that barring rare one-offs, warm-up underplays or secret shows, Twenty One Pilots will never play a venue this small again.

The second is that within the next 12 months, give or take, they will headline at least one arena on British soil.

The third - and you can cut this out and keep it - is that at some point in the years ahead, Twenty One Pilots will headline Reading & Leeds Festival.

They aren't arrogant enough to know it - they still appear to have no idea how good they are - but given what has happened up until this point, one would hope that when those moments arrive, the pair won't waste any time pinching themselves.

"Before we even started playing together, we started dreaming together," Josh confesses. "Before there were shows with hardly anyone there, there were dreams and goals that stretched to the levels we are currently approaching, as well as beyond.

"We talked about playing stadiums - that's something we have shied away from sharing before because it's a weird thing to say - but we always felt that it was important to have big dreams. If you convince yourself that something is already the biggest it can possibly be, that is the biggest it will ever be.

"We don't expect anything that happens to us, but we believe that almost anything has the potential to," he closes, as Tyler nods in approval.

"Honestly? We just believe in the unbelievable."
