### **Chapter 3**

LEGACIES ARE AT the centre of everything we do.

Be our aspirations big or small, what we will one day leave behind ultimately fuels much of our existence. To live is to die; with death comes uncertainty; with uncertainty comes fear. The urge to leave a legacy is one steeped in the unknown, driven by a desire to avoid disappearing and, with it, being forgotten.

It's a notion born of the all-too-terrifying reality that the world will continue to turn when our day finally comes, and the knowledge that outside of our nearest and dearest, few, if any, will pause to reflect on what it was that we had to offer the world.

On the fourth floor of his record label's palatial London headquarters, in a bright and airy room overlooking a train station platform filled with people who probably have such thoughts on an almost daily basis - or maybe, if they're lucky, they don't - Tyler Joseph is pondering what it is that he will one day leave behind.

"When I look back on the last few years of my life, I see just how much the idea of [leaving] some sort of legacy has changed," he whispers. "My outlook was always that if just one person could be helped or encouraged by our songs, my entire existence would be justified.

"It's only recently that I have started to think about how long songs live for and the fact that they remain long after we depart. We're going to get old and people are going to stop caring about what we have to say, but our music and our message is going to live on.

"When you realise that your music will outlive you, the process of writing a song becomes a daunting experience."

Today, of all days, thinking about the end seems more than a little premature. Several storeys beneath him beside the entrance to a building that houses many of the world's great labels, and which, in turn, lays claim to many of the world's most famous artists, sits a poster for Blurryface.

The second major label release that Tyler and his friend Josh Dun have put their names to, the album has seen the pair go from being music's best-kept secret to its worst-predicted success. Its songs have been streamed billions of times and shifted millions of physical copies - making chart history, breaking records, and winning numerous awards.

It hasn't even started to slow down.

The day after our most recent encounter, Tyler and Josh will co-headline the second stage at Reading Festival - an event they last appeared at three years ago as the opening band on the festival's smallest stage - while today they're having their picture taken to appear on the cover of Rock Sound for the fourth time in just under 18 months.

Dressed almost entirely in white and with a backwards cap hiding his freshly-bleached locks, Josh cuts a looser and more relaxed figure than his bandmate. A laid-back foil to Tyler's occasionally brooding intensity, the events of the last year are not lost on him.

A few days ago, the drummer had his first run-in with the paparazzi in Los Angeles. A hail of camera flashes punctuated by total strangers screaming his name despite him not having the first idea of theirs, he describes the encounter as "hollow", making him feel as though he was having some sort of currency stripped from his soul.

As one-half of what is currently the most famous musical duo on the planet, it's something he knows will require some getting used to.

"We have believed in what this band is since the very beginning," says Josh. "We always felt the weight and impact of the songs, and we have wanted to share those thoughts and feelings with as many people as possible.

It never had anything to do with fame or the notion of being recognised.

"We're still learning to be at peace with that stuff, but in terms of our goals and ambitions, the last 18 months have far exceeded those. In terms of where we thought we would be at this point, it's a whole other world." He isn't wrong, and it's a world that, on just about every level, belongs to Twenty One Pilots. Within any genre, not just rock, there is no comparison to the feats that have been achieved with Blurryface.

It's an album that has raised the bar not for alternative music but for contemporary music itself. It is a genuine, bona fide phenomenon the likes of which the world might not see again for many years.

It is, in all probability, one of the most important albums in a generation, and as such, its creators are one of the most curious cases of our time.

I find myself standing in the cramped and sweaty confines of Oxford's Academy II - a venue capable of hosting a mere 400 people - and I'm here to see the latest signing to the Atlantic Records-owned subsidiary Fueled By Ramen. Home to the likes of Paramore and Panic! At The Disco, the label has a long and established reputation for having its finger firmly on the pulse of rock and alternative culture, as well as shaping much of how the genres are viewed by the wider world.

Tonight, though, feels different.

Far from gathering to witness the latest signing to a label that enjoys cultural prominence and commercial success like most of us enjoy a biscuit and a cup of coffee, the people present are here specifically for this band.

From the moment they emerge - accompanied by just a drum kit, a piano and a ukulele - it's obvious that mere intrigue isn't on anybody's agenda besides mine. For the hour or so that the pair are onstage, and despite them having just one freely available album - one ignored by virtually every music publication in the United Kingdom - every person sings every word to every song.

The screams, the fanfare, and the bedlam that erupts throughout are unlike anything I have seen. What's more, the songs are unlike anything I have ever heard.

Although they won't release their next album for another 15 months, it's plainly obvious that this band - Twenty One Pilots - has the power to change the world.

"I remember when they first signed to the label, and somebody from the American office sent me a three-track sampler from [FBR debut] Vessel," remembers Mark Mitchell, General Manager of Atlantic Records UK. "It had a post-it note stuck on it that said, "This band will change your life.' There can be a lot of bluster in the music industry, but those words have continued to ring true.

"I was intrigued by the songs, but it wasn't until | saw them live at the London Barfly in 2013 that 1 truly understood what this band was. Vessel hadn't even been released in the UK at that point - I was standing in a crowd of no more than 100 people - and out of everybody, only me and the rest of the team [from Atlantic] didn't know every word. We stood there and went, 'What's going on?!'

"It's quite an admission for me to make, but we were behind the fans on [understanding] this."

Even in those earliest moments, far more was going on than met the eye. Having spent 2013 touring constantly, playing anywhere and everywhere that would have them, nights like the one I witnessed in Oxford a year later appeared to capture a band laying foundations.

In actuality, those foundations had been laid long before then. By the time I encountered them, Twenty One Pilots were building walls.

"After we released Vessel, we started working on new songs almost immediately," remembers Josh.

"Blurryface was being created and imagined while we were still promoting an album that most people hadn't even heard - that's how far ahead we were working. As Vessel started to grow, we started having more and more conversations about what came next.

"When you're putting out your first record, you can do whatever you want - there are no expectations. If people react positively, it gets tougher. Suddenly, you've got something to follow. What we learned on Vessel was that, judging by the reaction, we already had a lot to live up to."

Josh estimates that 90 percent of Blurryface was written on the road - a task that was easier to facilitate as time went on. As Vessel grew slowly but surely, bigger luxuries became afforded to the pair, such as eventually being able to travel in a bus rather than a van.

With more space available, more ideas were born, and those ideas soon turned into songs as a mobile recording rig accompanied them in tour bus lounges and hotel rooms across the world. It's a way of working that has continued to form part of their everyday routine, with all manner of recording equipment joining them everywhere from Europe to Asia. It provides a constant outlet, no matter where or when inspiration strikes.

"It's incredibly helpful for Tyler and I to come offstage and jump straight into a studio," Josh explains.

"Whenever we're inspired by a crowd or a place, we have that outlet, and that's really important. Making Blurryface, we could look at a show we had just played and ask ourselves what we thought it could have done with to ramp things up a notch, and then we could apply that to what we were working on. We played in front of people, we gauged the response, and then we wrote songs inspired by it all.

"When we say that Blurryface belongs to the fans, we can back that up."

"Blurryface was inspired by faces [belonging to] people I was hoping to reach in some way," adds Tyler.

"All I cared about when [we were] writing and recording those songs was what my immediate family would think and what the fans we had at that time would think. I don't want people to see us and nod their heads; I want them to feel part of it. Yes, I wanted to reach as many people as possible. but 1 wanted to grab those people and hold on to them. 1 knew that if we wanted to take it to the next level, those people had to show up before anyone else."

When Blurryface was eventually set free on an unsuspecting world in May of last year, it became clear that not only were people showing up but they were showing up at the exact same time.

Registering 147,000 combined sales in its first week, the album topped the charts in the United States, shaking the foundations of a woefully unprepared industry.

In the months to come, numerous songs trom the record dominated airwaves and broke countless records, topping one million sales in what felt like no time at all.

The album would see them welcomed onto red carpets and awards stages across the world, propelling Twenty One Pilots into arenas in nearly every city they visited.

Almost nobody saw it coming, at least when it came to those outside their circle.

"We knew that the fans were going to be there off the bat," says Chris Woltman, the band's manager. "From the moment that music started making its way into the world, there was a strong sense that people were rallying around this album and what it represented.

"We had three music videos out between the album being announced and being released, and you could feel the groundswell throughout. People weren't just listening to the songs, they were genuinely invested in them.

"As the weeks went by, it really started to raise its hand [as a contender], and by the time it came out, the surge of support was electric. The fans simply would not be stopped."

"When we were making the record, I didn't have a handle on what anything meant outside of simply making songs," Tyler admits. "I had no clue regarding chart positions. The idea that an entire record can be defined by how many people respond to it in the first week seems silly to me.

"I was thinking about that recently. Now that I know how things work, I wonder whether that knowledge will ruin the creation of the next record. I'm wondering if the magic of creating an album will suffer or if it'll seem shallow somehow. I'm wondering if it'll mean as much as it did."

He holds his thoughts for a second.

"I hope that it does."

The immediate, global impact of Blurryface was clear to see, hear and feel, even in the United Kingdom.

While in the country playing a handful of tiny shows the week before its release in May of 2015, the pair announced an even bigger tour for that November, including a date at London's 2,000-capacity Shepherd's Bush Empire. On location in a warehouse in east London, to be photographed for their first ever overseas magazine cover on the day that tickets went on sale, every single date was sold out in the time it took them to introduced themselves and climb the staircase leading up to their dressing room.

In September, two months before said tour would even begin, they announced another UK tour scheduled 
to take place in February of this year. Consisting of more than 30,000 tickets, almost all of them were snapped up before the preceding November visit even began. By the time that said November tour was over, absolutely none were left, and Blurryface was officially a phenomenon.

Sitting with the pair in their dressing room at Birmingham Academy on February 23, 2016, it was clear that the speed and ferocity of their rise was far from lost on the men at the centre of it.

"We always like to tell ourselves that we're visiting old friends when we play shows," Tyler told me, "but the truth is that while there will be people who were there last time, this thing is moving so fast that we're always meeting more new people than old. Every show becomes an exercise in trust building; teaching people how things go.

"When Josh and I stand on top of the crowd, will people know what to do, or will they drop us? The surge towards the stage is getting bigger and stronger every night. Will people continue to look out for each other?

Can I keep them safe? I'm thinking about those things every night."

The tour that the pair were on that day arrived following their first brief period off since Blurryface began. It gave both men the opportunity to reflect, as well as spend time with their loved ones. For the first time in what felt like a very long time, it also gave them the chance to simply be human. Not that this necessarily sat well with both of them.

"Time off is something that I struggle with," admits Josh. "I'm the kind of guy who likes waking up to a full calendar, otherwise I worry about whether or not we're losing ground. Whenever we have time off, even just a week, I start wondering what people are thinking. 'Are people forgetting about us? Do they still care if we're not doing something to prove ourselves? Have they already found something else to occupy their time?'"

"Our perspective on this thing is so zoomed [in] that we feel like our careers hinge on every show," Tyler adds. "Every show feels like a moment when we take this thing, pick it up and move it forward. To not play a show makes us wonder if someone has moved it back, or if somebody else has moved further forward than us. We've done nothing but tour for the last several years, and all we've done is see this thing grow. It's ingrained in us to feel the two things go hand in hand. Before we had thousands of people in every room - before we had a Gold record or songs on the radio - all we had was the show and the audience. It feels like if we don't play shows, that growth stops. We've never experienced any form of success that we weren't told about [while sitting] in a dressing room.

"We're slowly realising that we can take a week off, or maybe even a few weeks off, and things will still move forward, but I don't know if I want to lose that fear. I don't know if I want to be totally at peace with that.

"If we ever allowed ourselves to feel like we had made it and that this thing will just fly itself, it would probably never fly as high as it could."

Besides hard work and an ever-evolving live spectacle, there was plenty else to consider.

Despite its now-iconic music video being released almost a full year prior, 'Stressed Out' - the third track to be revealed before Blurryface's release - was becoming a hit. Topping radio charts in every corner of the globe, the video was being played two million times per day on YouTube. It began to dominate every music streaming platform, dragging other tracks from the album and the band's back catalogue with it. It even appeared on Lip Sync Battle, a television show where some of the biggest celebrities in the world engage in a display of over-the-top miming and choreography in front of a global audience of millions.

However, the track's success didn't just affect the size of the audience, but rather its entire genetic makeup.

Exposing them to more and more people, suddenly, every social demographic knew their names.

The audience was evolving every single night, and it was something that Josh, in particular, had started to spend a lot of time thinking about.

"I know from being a fan myself that when you discover a band, there's a sense of pride in [finding out] about them before anyone else. You feel like they're somehow your band, so I get how some people could be slightly bummed out [by our success]. I hate the idea of that pride being stripped away from anybody, but at the same time, we've never believed in limits or ceilings.

"The entire purpose of this band is to push those Limits - to evolve and better ourselves. I hope that people continue to take pride in it."

TYLER: "Do you think we should have never let any of our songs go on the radio? What would today look like if we had never allowed it?"

JOSH: "It would probably be different."

TYLER: "Would it?"

JOsH: "Actually - who knows? We never got signed for a smash hit song, and we never purposefully wrote one. We got signed because people made a lot of noise, and because a small number of people made enough of a racket to make people notice what we were doing. A much larger group of people making a lot more noise is always going to be difficult to ignore."

Back on the fourth floor, Tyler still has questions regarding much of the past year.

Less than two weeks before our latest conversation, he was standing onstage at Madison Square Garden in front of over 20,000 people. Exactly 24 hours later, he repeated the experience, bringing the curtain down on a summer-long North American tour that took in almost 50 shows and welcomed more than half a million people.

All things considered, Blurryface has seen the duo tick off most bands' entire bucket list in a little over a year.

What could there possibly be left to ponder?

"Sometimes I wonder whether I would have liked to have gone at a slower, gentler pace," he sighs, "I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is that even though the pace has quickened, we haven't sacrificed anything. We have made a deliberate decision to play the right room in every city and country we visit. We never lose sight of where we feel we are, or what we feel capable of delivering.

"Even if somebody says we can play somewhere wice the size, we will play the room we want to play, and that we are comfortable we can deliver in," he continues.

"The demand to see this band comes from the quality of the shows and the trust people have in us to deliver.

If we had spent the last year playing venues we can fl in terms of sheer demand alone, rather than playing the rooms we feel comfortable taking on, none of it would work. It just so happens that as time goes on, those two things are moving closer and closer together."

While some things are naturally moving closer, others seem further apart than ever. For one, the notion of any sort of home life. With the touring cycle for Blurryface set to roll on for at least another six months, such is the sheer demand from a public that continues to flock to them at a frightening pace, it's something that isn't looking overly obtainable any time soon.

It's something the pair have had to work around in different ways - Tyler bringing his wife Jenna on tour wherever possible and Josh throwing himself further and further into the touring mindset. In some ways, the drummer has created a world where there is no other way of life, focusing entirely on what needs to be done in the here and now.

I wonder, though, if such an intense work ethic is also a way of protecting himself from dwelling on the things he subsequently misses out on.

"There are a lot of things I'm grateful for and that I'm blessed to have in my life," he says, "but there are also huge sacrifices. You miss out on a lot, from birthdays to anniversaries and everything in between. Those are moments you will never (be able to] replace.

"That said, I do like being busy. Nothing scares me more than the idea of having nothing to do."

One of the things that may trouble him most, however, is fame. Were he to have walked into this building 12 months ago - a building that regularly sees the likes of Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars frequent its corridors - only the handful of people charged with directly working with the band would have recognised him. Even some of them might have failed to recognise him straight away.

These days, the people polishing the floors would likely know his name, as would the person driving the car that dropped him off at the door.

Throw in his recent encounter with the paparazzi and it's safe to say that Josh Dun's stock has never been higher. With the drummer residing in Los Angeles rather than Columbus, it's unlikely to sink.

"Being recognised is one of the weirdest feelings in the world," he blushes. "I don't feel any different now than I did when I was 19 - I feel like the same person.

"Some of the experiences are more intense, though.

Tyler and I are used to people approaching us with a story about our music and how it has affected or helped them, and that's the stuff we love. It's a meaningful encounter when it occurs, but it feels like more and more people are starting to look for something else. Some people want a picture with us, or of us, to put online because someone else might know who we are, and it'll impress them. It's an odd thing, leaving my house and feeling as though I might have people clicking cameras in my face.

"If that's the price that I have to pay for getting the life that I have, playing music to thousands of people and hanging out with my best friend every night, then it's worth it, and I would never pretend otherwise, but I don't always feel comfortable with that side of it."

"I will tell you now that the whole fame thing has gotten old," Tyler continues. "Fame has never been something I craved, as much as 1 was aware that it could arrive. I always wanted to affect a large number of people.

I wanted to speak to them - maybe even help them or change the way they feel - but perhaps naively, I never really comprehended what I might have to exchange to achieve those things.

"The most basic things can be frustrating. Everything you say or do online is critiqued and dissected, and if you even hint at where you might be or what you might be doing then you could ruin a family vacation or a day out with your wife. It's a lot harder to turn off than I ever thought it would be. I'm grateful that I stayed in Columbus, and I'm grateful that I'm surrounded by friends and family, as well as the familiarity.

"If I were [living] somewhere else like Los Angeles or New York, I don't know that dealing with or processing that stuff would work out."

For Tyler especially, it's easy to imagine such intense scrutiny would be a challenging prospect. Although far more introverted than his bandmate, he's arguably even more famous - a trait that comes purely by proxy of being the frontman. He's also made a lasting impression on popular culture; his bright red beanie made famous in the video for 'Stressed Out taking on the same iconic, cultural significance of Michael Jackson's white glove in the eyes of the Tumblr generation.

At the time of writing, his Twitter and Instagram followers add up to a total of just under four million, and rising. Fast. All real people, all just waiting for a glimpse into his life.

Or perhaps, he suggests, something more.

"I have all these eyes and ears on me now, just waiting for me to do or say something shocking," he says, with a slight twinkle in his eye. "I can't give in to that. While it provides temptation, it would be too easy - as simple as getting on my phone and typing something provocative into Twitter. Tap, tap, tap... pandemonium.

"I understand now why some famous people like to do that, because it's amazing how much and how easily people can freak out about something. It would even be easy for us to take that mindset and apply it to our music - to make the next song or album something shocking - but those [things] aren't top of my priorities list.

"I want the next song to be the right one, not one designed solely to provoke."

---

It's clear that the existence of that next song or album is already being considered, and if recent events are anything to go by, the demand is higher than ever.

Written for the soundtrack to summer blockbuster Suicide Squad, 'Heathens' recently provided the world with its first taste of new music in over a year, as well as becoming one of the band's most commercially successful songs to date.

Even their cover of My Chemical Romance's "Cancer' -which I enlisted the band to record to mark the tenth anniversary of The Black Parade - found its way into the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.

The whole world, it seems, is waiting for what's next.

As for Tyler? He's been thinking about the challenge 

a lot more than you might think.

"As I was standing onstage at Madison Square Garden," he tells me, "I looked up and saw a banner that said Billy Joel has played there 78 times. If I were ever worried about losing my tenacity or drive for this band, or what I could achieve as part of it, that banner wiped all of those feelings out in a second.

"We have punched through walls, quickly, but there are walls I don't even know about yet. If I can't find any more, I'm going to build my own.

"Right now, I'm facing leven more walls]. I'm thinking about the next record and what it sounds like, what the narrative is and where it takes us, and it's my biggest challenge to date. When you create and experience something as monumental as Blurryface, it becomes about proving you can do it again.

"I would be lying if I told you I know I can [do it]. I think I can, I hope that I can, but am I certain? Not at all, but I don't want to keep doing this if there aren't things I'm trying to overcome."

It's the notion of overcoming that is arguably more important now than it has ever been for the pair. For all its chart-topping success and numerous accomplishments, what Blurryface represents is insecurity and the constant struggle to defeat the anxieties and worries that plague every living human.

It's often said that love is the most powerful emotion in the world, but it's an album that has made millions of people question whether, in all honesty, it's fear that lays claim to such a title.

It's been present throughout every paragraph of this article, from the idea of legacies and what we leave behind to the uncertainty of what happens if we dare to stop and catch our breath. Those fears are present in virtually everyone, regardless of whether or not you happen to stand on a stage for a job.

For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, the worry that we aren't fulfilling our potential and the crippling doubt of what it is that we will one day be remembered for reigns supreme.

What Blurryface represents is a journey that takes people to the core of those fears. It's therefore no wonder the entire world has fallen at its feet.

"Even if the radio stations stopped playing their music tomorrow and even if the press never wrote another word about them, it wouldn't impact or affect their success at all," claims Mark Mitchell. "The band has become so powerful and organic that even if nobody supported it outside of its core fanbase ever again, they would still headline Reading & Leeds in the next few years."

"At this point, it would be difficult to look at everything that has been accomplished on this record and say that we knew we would do it all inside 18 months," adds Chris Woltman. "We have continued to engage with a fanbase that was already growing and is hugely passionate about the band, and there is a lot of power in that.

"We always said that we don't want to be part of pop culture - we want to bring pop culture to us. We want to take our culture into the world."

As for the two people responsible? They're still largely oblivious to just how rare this has been. Maybe one day, perhaps in a few months when the dust finally settles, they'll allow themselves to see what has been achieved. 

Then again, that would require actually stopping.

"I am aware of everything that has happened," admits Josh. "It is not lost on me that we have done something amazing, but I haven't delved too far into it. I feel like focusing too much on what has gone on could end up distracting me from the present and what it is we still have left to do."

"I haven't even thought about this cycle in any real detail," continues Tyler, "and that's because it has been such a monumental time in my life that I don't even feel ready to try to wrap my head around it. I'm sure that I will, but it was such a huge series of moments that I feel it deserves for me to truly understand it.

"I've asked myself if it would be best to never really look back on it - I have thought about whether analysing it could do more harm than good - but to do so would be to stunt my creativity. When I start to dive into writing another record, I will look back on this chapter of my life as a source of inspiration, and those people who were there for that time are going to have songs written about them. They don't know it, but they're writing the next chapter of this band already."

If the current chapter has been anything to go by, whatever comes next will see more people with songs written about them than those who don't.
