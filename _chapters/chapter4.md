## **Chapter 4: Cancer**

AT EXACTLY 6 AM on Thursday, June 23, 2022, I watched my brother die.

For the last several months, ever since I first decided to publish this book, the above words are the only ones I have been able to put on the page. Day after day, week after week, I have tried and failed to find a way to start this chapter, let alone finish it.

There are two main reasons for that:

The first is that, ironically, I don't really enjoy writing.

Ever since I started doing so almost two decades ago, the process of structuring a piece - be it a short review or a feature spanning thousands of words - has at times made me so stressed and anxious that I have been physically sick. Maybe it's because of my complete lack of training of any kind-I didn't even complete my secondary school education, let alone attend college or university - meaning that when it comes to putting metaphorical pen to paper, I haven't got the first clue as to what I'm 'supposed' to be doing.

Maybe it's a byproduct of being raised in a family with two significantly older brothers (nine and 11 years, respectively), both of whom I spent my entire adolescence feeling as though I could never compete with, leaving me with a chip on my shoulder that can act as both my biggest strength and most glaring weakness.

Most likely, it's because like almost everybody else in the world, no matter how much I might try to pretend otherwise, I care what people think about me, and that means 1 care about whether or not they judge my work to be good. Just as anger comes from fear, ego comes from insecurity. I would therefore be lying if I said that a huge part of why I have spent my entire adult life doing what I do, despite its effects on me, comes from anything other than a desire to feel as though I'm the best.

Or at least that I might have the potential to be.

Whether I like it or not, and whether I want it or not, the ability to tell stories continues to play a huge role in my life. However, it's only when the task of doing so is over that I tend to feel much in the way of joy.

"I don't know how you do it," Tyler once said to me, after I explained to him that virtually all of the features I have ever written on the band have been created in the space of no more than a couple of days, thanks to our conversations eternally finding a way to take place as close to my deadline as humanly possible.

The same way you probably go about writing a song, Tyler. Only my existential crisis comes with a much smaller dressing room.

The second - and as you've probably guessed, given I've spent the last several hundred words desperately trying to avoid getting to the point, the one that weighs heaviest - is that no matter how much time passes, reading the opening sentence to this chapter leaves me feeling as though I'm back in the room, watching my eldest sibling, Chris, take his final breath. A front-facing bedroom inside my parents' home that he quickly claimed when we moved in some 34 years ago - a bedroom that I would one day inherit - it's a room that these days feels cold and empty.

It's more of a tomb: a constant reminder that my family as I had always known it is no more.

A giant in every way - his six-foot-four frame eclipsed only by his often bullish and dominant personality - Chris wasn't always the easiest person to co-exist with, 

let alone follow. We were brothers, but our differenc cases our startling similarities, meant ve were never friends. Although I wish that we had been.

It's therefore ironic, but perhaps fitting, that 1 was the only member of the family by his side as he passed away, in the room that we had both once called our own. After an entire year spent battling the most evil and disgusting type of cancer that any human being could ever be forced to confront, even the man who always seemed like a colossus to me couldn't fight any longer. If he couldn't win, absolutely nobody could.

Despite our many differences, the physical and mental strength he showed when confronted with one of the worst adversaries imaginable leaves me feeling incredibly proud of him. While I'll never get the opportunity to tell him that, I can at least tell the rest of the world.

Seven years earlier, it was a fate that I had feared I would meet myself.

After 18 months of appointments, being ignored and enduring excruciating pain that felt as though somebody was drilling through the back of my skull, a tumour was found tucked berween my spinal cord and the base of my brain. Although benign, the tumour represented a grave threat on multiple fronts. Brutally, I was told that although the tumour was not currently cancerous, there was no way of knowing if or when that might change.

Furthermore, due to the location of the tumour, removing it would pose an incredible risk. According to surgeons, I was only the second person on record to be diagnosed with this type of tumour in that exact spot, and as a result, there was no successful surgery on record.

The message was blunt and harrowing: any attempt to remove it could well leave me paralysed or dead.

As a result, all they could do was try to manage the pain and keep me under regular surveillance, leading to several years of living on an emotional treadmill. Every few months, I would be placed inside a machine that felt like a coffin and scanned for an hour at a time, before being called in to receive the results several weeks later.

The cycle was mentally devastating. No sooner had I been told that one scan had shown no change, the appointment letter for the next scan would arrive. There was no end in sight, merely a series of fleeting reprieves.

It left me feeling as though I was living with a grenade inside of my head that could go off at any minute.

Although it never took my life, it took over it.

It was just weeks after my tumour was discovered - on May 15,2015, to be exact - that I first met Tyler and Josh.

In my then-capacity as Editor of Rock Sound, I sat down with them for nearly 90 minutes, discussing everything from their humble beginnings to their innermost hopes for what was already looking like a glittering future.

What struck me during our encounter was not the noticeably good manners or the sincerity of their gratitude for being given a platform, but the very real level of importance that they placed on our meeting.

Over the last two decades, I've conducted hundreds of interviews with artists of all sizes, from those I never heard from again to others who now inhabit stadiums.

Some find the idea of interviews and photoshoots to be some sort of hindrance, or even a God-given right, while even those who treat the occasions with respect often do so in a manner that is entirely uniform.

To Tyler and Josh, however, it mattered. Interruptions to our conversation felt like a genuine invasion of privacy, as though the red light on my tape recorder was some kind of precious resource, while the subsequent photoshoot was treated with as much care and precision as any show they've performed in the years since.

For several hours, they stood among an increasingly thick smog, surrounded by rows of distress flares and smoke grenades that produced a surprisingly potent stench, without so much as a groan. Most people might not think of this as being a big deal, but trust me: is extremely rare.

What I learned most about the two that day came not from anything they said, but from what they did and how they did it. Quite honestly, they just wanted it.

I left our encounter with a far deeper respect for Twenty One Pilots, but also with an idea.

In the days leading up to our meeting, I had been mulling over potential cover stars and angles for not just the remainder of 2015 but for 2016, even though a part of me secretly wondered whether I would live that long.

At the top of the notes I had made on my phone - some of the ideas were terrible, the rest were merely pretty bad - were three words that I had typed in big, bold letters:

The Black Parade.

I had recently put together a covers album to mark Rock Sound's 200th issue, with the compilation being given away for free in CD form with copies of the magazine. Revolving around some of the key artists in the brand's world covering a collection of rock floor-fillers exclusively for the occasion - featuring the likes of You Me At Six, Architects, Enter Shikari, Neck Deep and more - it's an album that I remain incredibly proud to have assembled.

Having already made an album of sorts, I wondered whether taking the concept and using it to recreate an entire record from start to finish as opposed to a broad collection of songs from multiple artists would be a suitable way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of one of the most pivotal albums of the 21st Century. Despite my own tastes being more Mudvayne than My Chemical Romance, I understood the scale of The Black Parade both creatively and in terms of what it meant to millions of people. With well over a year until the album reached its celebratory milestone, it was doable, or at least felt as much. If nothing else, it would give me something to focus on beyond my own mortality.

I had already made a list of bands I thought would be suitable, not just culturally but sonically. Listening to the album, I could hear how specific songs would sound being performed by certain bands, whether it be the result of sticking closely to the original or putting their own spin on things. Not every artist I approached said yes, but a pretty large majority did, and almost nobody pushed back on the tracks I had asked them to tackle.

The song I had no idea how to approach, however, was "Cancer'. Positioned smack bang in the middle of the record in terms of running time (always pay attention to the middle of something), it's a phenomenal piece of music. Despite being surrounded by some of the most bombastic, glorious, theatrical rock songs of the last few decades, its simplicity - the entire track built around a lone piano and elevated by one of Gerard Way's most sensational vocal performances - is also its strength.

Written trom the perspective of a cancer patient who is slowly succumbing to the disease, at that time in my lite, the song resonated with me in a way that I didn't welcome in many ways. Nonetheless, it was a song that needed to be there.

On the day of our first meeting, shortly before the photoshoot began, the location manager had been looking through a cupboard filled with props and artefacts that had been left to gather dust over the years when they stumbled across a piano. Minutes later, the instrument had made its way to the centre of the studio floor. As people frantically moved lights and canvases into position ahead of the shoot, Tyler placed his hands on the keys and began to play a series of random and seemingly meaningless chords. They were solemn; sad but not fearful. Accepting, almost.

As he played - as oblivious to the people around him as they were to the sounds escaping his fingertips - 1 opened the notes application on my phone containing the provisional track listing for the tribute album that would go on to be Rock Sound Presents: The Black Parade.

Where previously there had been a blank space next to 'Cancer', I quickly typed the words: "Twenty One Pilots?'

A few weeks later, I decided to chance my arm by emailing the band's manager, Chris Woltman.

Although I've since spent over nine years being a persistent thorn in his side, at the time, we had never spoken. To my surprise, he replied almost immediately, and within a few short minutes, we were beginning a conversation over the phone that would last for more than an hour.

By then, Blurryface had been released and was turning Tyler and Josh into global superstars. Chris enthusiastically reeled off all manner of eye-watering numbers, including album and ticket sales, while also informing me that the band was now the second-highest seller nationally for a well-known American clothing and merchandise retailer.

Yes. That one.

At the current rate, he told me, Twenty One Pilots would become the brand's best-selling artist inside the next few months, leapfrogging a band that had been top of the pile for the better part of a decade.

My Chemical Romance.

I already felt there was as good as no chance of the band being interested in taking part, but upon learning this I felt genuinely embarrassed to be asking the question.

At least the segue would be flawless, I told myself.

To my surprise, Chris didn't baulk at the idea, instead asking me to send him an email detailing the what, the where and the when, but most crucially, the why. He was extremely open in saying that, as continues to be the case, the band's involvement would be based purely on creative merit. Nothing else would be of initial concern.

After thinking it over for a few hours, I decided to explain exactly why 'Cancer' was such a difficult song for me to approach. I was concerned that my honesty might be seen as some kind of guilt trip or emotional 

battering ram, and that revealing such struggles might be too much, too soon. However, I also wanted to be honest and open, just as Ihad felt Tyler and Josh had been during our first meeting. Maybe a part of me was simply looking for a way to vent, or to unload the thoughts in my head. Whatever the reason, 1 wrote down exactly what the song meant to me, as well as why I wanted them to be the ones to take it on.

I spoke of my recent diagnosis and how the idea of my rumour ever metastasising hiled me with constant dread, the mental strain that it caused me every single day and some of the ways in which the lyrics of the song now resonated with me. To this day, I have no idea whether Tyler and Josh ever read the full email or were merdy given the short version.

Within a week of my email, their answer arrived:

They were in.

To be honest, I'm as shocked today as I was nine years ago. Despite their assurances, I don't know that I ever really believed that it would happen, particularly given their trajectory. With each passing day, the band was becoming a global behemoth. I began to see their merchandise being worn by passers-by on a daily basis, and it became impossible to turn on a radio or television without hearing or seeing them.

Every time I checked in with Chris, I did so with the full expectation that each email or phone call would be the one where I would finally be told of the inevitable change of plan. Even when sitting with Tyler and Josh in person, I was scared to bring it up.

Whatever people may think or assume, there were no rules or restrictions regarding any aspect of the song, at least from my end. Honestly, I was too busy waiting for things to go wrong to tell anybody how I thought the song should sound in any great detail.

The last discussion I remember having about the song took place in Birmingham on February 23, 2016. Several hours before their show at the city's Academy music venue, between mouthfuls of burgers and fries ("You're not going to write about how terrible our diet is, are you?" Tyler joked, not knowing that I wouldn't sell him out for another eight years, the conversation briefly turned to Cancer and its meaning. While the subject was raised only for a few minutes, for the first time since Tapproached them some months earlier, I allowed myself to believe the song might see the light of day.

When the track finally arrived in my inbox in July, weeks after the release of 'Heathens' had seen the pair's popularity reach such enormity that they had become arguably the biggest band on Earth at that moment, I sat and stared at the email for what felt like an hour.

By then, my physical and mental health had hit rock bottom. Following the project's completion, I was reluctantly leaving my job in a futile attempt to claw back some control over my sanity, and was back to living in my family home as the final months of my twenties swirled down the drain. Most of my days were spent feeling lost, crippled, and overcome with an existential dread that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

In the moment, though, I felt something I hadn't for well over a year. Something I firmly believe is the most crucial feeling that any human being can experience.

I felt alive.

I carried my laptop upstairs to my bedroom, closed the door, and nervously pressed play. What followed completely floored me. Although obviously different, the song resonated with me in an even deeper manner than the original. It didn't just sound different - it felt different.

The original version was one of staunch defiance, despite its hopeless subject matter. It was the sound of somebody aware of their fate and in total denial at the same time.

It was as though if they sang passionately enough, they could somehow flip the outcome on its head. To my ears, it was the sound of somebody angry and unaccepting of the cards they had been dealt.

This version, though, was wearier. It was frail and gentle; the voice of a person resigned to defeat. It was the sound of someone who had accepted the hopelessness of their situation and was tired of trying to make things better, and who was done with trying to believe that things would improve. It summed up exactly how I was feeling. For the very first time, it made me feel as though my emotions were understood by another human being.

As soon as the song finished, I burst into tears.

There were so many reasons for my reaction. Of course, the stress and uncertainty of my health were ultimately at the top of that list, but I was also relieved. In my head, the project had become so much more than a collection of cover songs. On a good day, it was something I saw as my final offering to a job and an industry I had wanted to work in since I was a child. On a bad day, I saw it as my final offering to the world

I didn't know what the future held or whether there was even a future at all, but I knew that I would have something meaningful to sign off with, even if things never got better.

Mostly, though, I was overwhelmed that the band had come through on their promise. They never had to commit in the first place, but they certainly never had to see it through when they had ample opportunity and reason to drop out at any point. They had been true to their word, but more importantly, they had treated the task with a respect that went above and beyond what was necessary.

As human beings, it spoke - and continues to speak - volumes about their character.

On the day that I watched my brother take his final breath, while standing in the same room I had first heard the song in six years earlier, I went to see the band play at London's Brixton Academy. Despite not being in the country for nearly three years, they were less than 90 minutes from my front door, on that day of all days. I was in two minds as to whether or not to go, but my mother insisted that so long as I felt it was safe, I should try to carry on as normal.

Barely an hour before they were due onstage, Chris [Woltman] walked me through the venue's backstage corridors and pushed open the door to a dressing room where Tyler and Josh were waiting for me. I couldn't even begin to tell you much of what we spoke about for the half-hour or so that we were together. I was in a daze - simultaneously exhausted and in shock. All I know is that even if by pure chance, they were once again there for me in my most difficult moment.

Even though, as ever, they didn't need to be.

As I made my way home after the show and a new to the blackness of the English countryside, l put my earphones in and hit shuffle on a random Twenty One Pilots playlist. With no more than 15 minutes remaining on my journey, the opening sounds of "Cancer' began to creep into my ears. I hadn't listened to the track in many months - maybe even a year or more. Despite the devastating events of the previous day, I felt no urge to stop it. Rather than experiencing any feelings of griet or sorrow, I instead felt strangely at peace.

I thought about my oldest friend, Dan, who had passed away from cancer just six months before my brother.

On the day that he passed, Dan married his girlfriend while lying in his hospital bed, with his mother and sister present. Not long after he had nodded his way through his vows and kissed his wife for what would be the one and only time, as his family left the room, he asked a nurse for an ice pop to soothe his mouth. He ate it alone and quickly went to sleep.

He died minutes later, aged 36.

I thought not only about my brother and the things that he would never get the chance to do, but about what was now left of my family.

I wondered what the weeks and months ahead would do to my parents, as well as my remaining brother, Nick.

I wondered how they would cope. I wondered how we would cope.

I thought about my own health, which thankfully has improved immensely these days. My tumour is still there, but it doesn't affect me anymore, physically or mentaly.

I no longer have any pain, and as long as that remains the case, I no longer need to be on the endless treadmill of dread that once consumed me.

I thought about how lucky I was to be alive. I also wondered whether it was fair that I was.

Lastly, I thought about how much my brother would have loved to have been at the show that night. He was someone who always treated music as something to be listened to rather than consumed by, but over the years he had become intrigued by my fascination with Twenty One Pilots. As a result, he had gradually become a genuine fan. While I had taken my mother to see and meet the band at London's Wembley Arena in early 2019, he had never made it to a show himself. Now, he would never have the chance.

It is because of my brother, though, that this book exists. A few months before his death, following yet another round of chemotherapy, he had been allowed home to recover for a brief period. Despite being under strict instructions to avoid exposure to direct sunlight as well as coming into contact with anybody outside of my parents' bubble -which pretty much meant them and only them - he snuck out of the house for a few minutes to see me as I cut the front hedge. It's only now that I appreciate the gesture he made by doing so, and how much seeing me must have meant to him that day.

After confessing that I had been feeling increasingly lost and unfulfilled, he told me I should release a book on the band. If my passion had made even him into a fan, he reasoned that there would surely be plenty of people who would love it.

More importantly, maybe I would love it.

I hope he knew how grateful I was to him for giving me the encouragement to pursue the idea.

By now, you're probably wondering what the main purpose of this chapter is. If I'm honest, I'm not sure I have a definitive answer.

Maybe it's a way for me to finally put the trauma of my past ordeals into words, both in terms of my struggles and the passing of those who weren't as lucky as I have been, so that I can finally begin to leave them behind.

Maybe it's just a mundane story about a man asking a band to record a song that has simply gotten out of hand, driven by his insecurities regarding the quality and value of his work and how it is that people view it, and in turn him.

Maybe it's all of the above.

What I would like it to be about, though, is gratitude.

It's something I should have shown a lot more of in my life. If you're honest with yourself, you will be able to say the same. I have few genuine regrets in life, but as the years pass and I grow older, the one giant in an otherwise modest collection is that I wish I had been more grateful.

I wish I had learned to say thank you more often, and to tell people how much I value and appreciate them being in my life, as well as letting me be in theirs.

I wish I had been nicer to people who deserved it, and maybe even a few of the ones who didn't.

I wish I had learned to savour the moment more, rather than always thinking about what would be coming next.

I wish I had been a better partner.

I wish I had been a better friend.

I wish I had been a better mentor.

I wish I had been a better brother, and a better son.

We can't change the past, but if you're reading this, you still have an opportunity to change the future.

Take the time to tell someone you love them. Learn to be more patient and empathetic. Find something - or someone- that gives you a purpose. Work hard to develop meaningful and fulfiling relationships, be they with your friends, your family, or even someone you work with.
Make peace with your flaws, and don't be afraid to raise people up or give credit to those who deserve it. Your life will be more fulfilling if you do.

Last, but by no means least, try to have faith in people. While that can be the hardest thing in the world

- other than writing for a living, of course - you might be surprised by people's generosity, or how it is they show you they care. Be it in the form of a kiss, a conversation, or an opportunity to do something you'll never forget.

Or, if you're really lucky, a song.
