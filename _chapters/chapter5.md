### **Chapter 5: Welcome to Trench**

CARS ARE THE window to the soul.

At first, you might not see it. Maybe you see something functional - a mere structure comprising of steel, rubber and glass, designed to get you from where you've been to wherever you're going.

If you think about it, a car is so much more than that.

It's a place where people form bonds and friendships through conversation and music. To some, it's a place they go to contemplate their thoughts, or perhaps even block them out completely. To others, it's the birthplace of a million ideas and felings, all of which are created and examined in one of the most hazardous environments in existence. An environment where one pull of the wheel or one press of the accelerator, can change everything, and where even through no fault of your own, your life can change in an instant.

The speed; the vibrations; the implications; the pressure. Really, how people drive their cars offers more of an insight into someone's state of mind than most of us ever realise. Hundreds and thousands of people simultaneously fighting to maintain control over their thoughts and emotions, trying to get safely to wherever it is that they need to be.

In all reality, the way you drive a car isn't about style or habit - it's a reflection of everything you're thinking and feeling at any given moment.

Tyler Joseph drives slower these days.

"In the past, I was always trying to get somewhere," he contemplates. "On the last record, especially before I went away on tour, driving a car was about getting the journey over with, so that I could get to where I needed to go.

"Over this last year, whenever I got into my car, I wasn't in a rush. I became aware of things that I would never have noticed before. I would be looking out of the window and thinking, "That's an awesome tree!' I would think about how long it had been there and all the changes that had taken place during its lifetime. I had missed being able to do that."

Cars have always played a starring role in the story of Twenty One Pilots. From 'Car Radio' on their major label debut Vessel to the music video for "Heavydirtysoul", the final visual representation of the record-breaking Blurryface that saw Tyler being driven at high speeds by a hooded and faceless figure, they have never been more than a stone's throw from the centre of one of the world's biggest bands.

Today, the drive to the outskirts of Columbus is different to any that has come before. For Tyler, the journey offcially represents the beginning of the cycle for Trench, the band's hugely-anticipated new album.

One that, until now, he and his best friend and bandmate Josh Dun are yet to talk about in any proper detail.

Today is the first time the pair will sit down to discuss any aspect of the album together, as a team, with anybody outside of their closest circle.

At the end of a long and perfectly paved driveway, inside the living room of the beautiful, suburban house that will host today's interview and accompanying photoshoot - the first for any outlet in the world on this cycle - stands a clothing rail. Hanging from it is a vast array of shirts, hoodies and jackets that are primarily green in colour. A pile of black military-style boots litter the floor.

Most prominently of all, on the back of a sola, st Standing in the room today, it dawns on me that a new era truly has well and truly begun.

The red hats; the backpacks; the grey coats; the brightly coloured suits; the black paint - none of those things are here. It isn't just me who feels the change

"Man, those suits were so hot," laughs Josh. "It's funny looking at all this, for sure. It's a big change. New wardrobe; new show; new setist - everything is new.

Even when you finish making a record, that's just one part of it. There's a [far bigger picture to be figured out.

"But dude, honestly, I can't wait to get started." If the response to the earliest tracks from Trench is anything to go by, then neither can the rest of the world, and as smiles and warm embraces give way to the matter at hand and the pair make their way down to the basement to begin our conversation, neither can I.

Everywhere that he looked, Tyler Joseph's world was being brutally dismantled.

Barely 30 minutes ago, he had been standing on top of a capacity crowd at the Schottenstein Center in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, as he and his bandmate smashed out the final beats of "Trees'. It was a moment that marked the end of the last show of the five-date Tour De Columbus - the final chapter of a two-year Blurryface touring cycle that saw them playing almost every venue the city had to offer in under a week. Entertaining a little under 50,000 people across all five shows, ranging from 200 to 20,000, almost half a million people had applied for tickets to share in this glorious finale.

Now, though, the room was empty. There were no more people to see, no more shows to perform, and no more videos to shoot. For the first time in a very long rime, there were no clues as to how long it would be before any of those things returned, if they even returned at all.

Standing alone and with no audience to speak to, the frontman was no longer the lead actor in a movie designed in his head and played out in front of thousands of people every night. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, he was a normal, regular person.

"There was something very powerful about soaking it all in," he recalls. "I wanted to take one last breath before diving into whatever was next. The only people [in the arena] were those picking up cables and taking the set apart for the last time, and what struck me was that nobody was stopping. They were just doing their jobs, and those jobs didn't end there. I realised that just because something was ending for us, it didn't mean it was ending for [the rest of the world.

"There's something healthy about that; realising that the world keeps turning. Sometimes, you can feel like the whole world is revolving around you. I think that we all selfishly get to that point. When you have those moments- when you stop and realise that even if you weren't there, those people would be - it lifts a weight.

"It motivates you to want to come up with a reason as to why you're here."

Tyler wasn't the only member of Twenty One Pilots beginning to contemplate a new way of life that night.

Throughout the time that I have known him, Josh has maintained that being on the road and the routine that touring life brings has been something he relishes. For him as well as Tyler, a period of adjustment was about to begin.

"It was pretty much a week of confict," he admits, looking back at those final shows.We were entering the unknown, just as soon as that last show was done.

"At the height of Blurryface, I think that we had started to feel a sense of security in where we were. We were in the midst of a [record] that was doing well, and people were showing up to concerts in huge numbers.

After a while, you're like, This is just working'. I always wanted to embrace that [feeling), because as time goes on, there's always the chance that it can go away.

"There might be more shows, and they might get even bigger, but they might also get smaller or disappear. That last week in Columbus - those final shows and especially that last night - was the first time that I began to feel somewhat fearful. It was taking away that security of knowing everything was okay.

"It was like, 'Well, here we go, on to the next thing that people may or may not like.""

Structure has always been important to the drummer.

Like his bandmate, as a child, he spent a number of years receiving his education at home, away from the public school system.

Looking back, he admits that there were times when he craved the rigid timetables and seemingly mundane structures experienced by most of the other kids who lived on his street. Routines that, on a molecular level, are also part and parcel of life on the road.

"Touring is great for [routine] and knowing you've got to do this at this time, or that at that time, and the whole schedule is built around this amazing show at the end of the day," he enthuses. "There's something comforting in being led rather than making your own decisions every day, but you can't be on tour all the time.

That just isn't what life looks like."

For a while at least, touring was the only thing that life seemed to resemble.

Throughout its lifespan, Blurryface saw the duo play well over 200 shows across the world, and with every leg, the crowds and venues grew. They announced tours, sold them out and then announced more with the same result, all before they had even played the first set of shows. It was relentless.

Theatres turned into arenas, globally. Two nights at New York's Madison Square Garden were sold to capacity months in advance, just as two nights at London's famous Brixton Academy were followed by two nights at the city's spectacular, 10,000-capacity Alexandra Palace.

By the time Tour De Columbus arrived to shut things down, the pair had torn through a bucket list that most bands will never complete, on just a single album cycle.

It was enough to leave many wondering where things could possibly go from there. Following Tour De Columbus' third show at the 5,000-capacity Express Live!, it was a question that even the two members were beginning to ponder.

Backstage after the show, as I bid them farewell for another cycle, Tyler left me with five words:

"I don't know what's next."

"I guess that, to clarify, I knew where 1 wanted the next story to go," he offers, looking back on our last meeting and those parting words. "I knew the story wanted to tell, and I knew the place I wanted to tell the story about, but what I didn't know was how to get everything out that was so internal, and that I had been thinking about for so long.

"Our career is so defined, between touring and then writing and recording, but those things are two completely different existences. The toughest thing for me to wrap my head around is when one of those things ends and the other begins, because it's a complete shift.

It's a shift in the way that you think, in how you go about each day, and in how you try to get things done.

"The last time you spoke to me, I was realising that this was all about to shift. I had been touring for over two years, and now I was going to go and write a record.

It's like looking into an abyss. You don't know what to expect - you're scared and you don't know if you can take everything you have been thinking about and make it real. You don't know if you can make it good." That Tyler's focus remains mainly on one thing - the idea that his work is of value and up to standard not just to himself but to those who hear it - suggests that while Blurryface may be in the past, the doubts and fears embodied by its lead character are yet to disappear.

Although it has been some 14 months since 1 left him on the brink of that void, in the middle of two worlds, it's clear that to an extent, he's still in that very place.

If only it had a name.

For Tyler and Josh, the pace and purpose of life changed almost instantly.

The sheer scale of an album and the magnitude of the show that Blurryface not only required, but demanded, had weighed heavily on their increasingly weary bones.

Now, however foreign or uncomfortable it may feel, it was about switching views. With nothing on the horizon, there was equally nothing to say, and so the pair did something that few people could have predicted and that even fewer would ever have had the courage to do:

They stopped talking.

A period that fans have since dubbed 'The Hiatus', it arrived approximately one week after the conclusion of Tour De Columbus and continued for nearly a full calendar year. It was a period that saw the band's social media accounts actively put to sleep in the form of a closing eye, while the two band members each proceeded to post absolutely nothing on any platform.

Just days after the final show of one of the biggest and most lucrative touring cycles making its way around the world, it was as though one of the biggest bands on Earth had simply disappeared.

"We have always been fascinated by the idea of abandoning social media," says Josh. "Even six or seven years ago, we would have conversations where we would wonder what would happen if we just deleted everything.

Would people care? Would they keep showing up? It felt like it was time to put it to the test.

"We were also wondering if it would be kind of weird to stick around, almost like we were lurking or lingering if there wasn't anything to say. I see people who cling to social media a little too much, and it can sometimes feel a little desperate.

"We needed to figure out what it was we wanted to talk [to people] about."

"I got rid of all the social media apps on my phone," Tyler adds. "It was part of slowing down, readjusting, and taking away that access. Social media is not all bad - we love having a platform where we can interact with people and see what they're saying - but to remove that ability to run to it was really important.

"Music is the thing 1 want to run to when I feel inspired. Whether it's frustration, anger, compassion or whatever it is that I want to express, I want it to live somewhere new. I didn't want a single drop of any meaningful expression to live anywhere else."

What we haven't touched on is what, or rather who, the pair left behind in the process.

From our first-ever conversation, Tyler has spoken frankly about the responsibility that comes with his position. It's a responsibility that many people shirk, often insisting that because they never formed a band to become a role model - because they never asked to be seen as a source of strength and inspiration to anybody - they don't need to own such a platform.

Then again, not many people know what a platform akin to that afforded to Twenty One Pilots looks like, Let alone understand the bond shared with its audience.

For the last two years in particular, the duo leaned on a fanbase that did the same in return. That community had been there to literally and physically hold them at every show, in every city and every country, without fail. It was there every night as the black paint smeared across Tyler's hands and neck - a physical representation of the frontman's struggles and insecurities - began to crack and crumble throughout the set.

Intensely and without wavering, both band and fans had continually been one. Without warning, that was no longer the case, and it was a discomfort felt from both sides of the barricade.

"[Going silent] broke my heart," Tyler whispers. "I felt very burdened by it, about what this time away was going to do to people. It always hurt that we weren't able to explain why we were gone and why we left so suddenly, but I'm an advocate of showing people what it is I've been creating, rather than telling them how hard I'm working. I want to show people the thing I've been working on, as opposed to them listening to me tell them how much I want them to hear it.

"I think that people get enough of that, and I don't think it's inspiring to hear anymore." There was, however, a secondary plot line.

First and foremost, the silence allowed the two to work on their next chapter, but it also served as an opportunity for them to hit refresh. There had been times during the previous cycle, particularly as momentum and a seat at the top table of popular culture violently collided, when the picture they saw was no longer the one they previously imagined.

"Some of those rooms [by the end of Blurryface] were really crowded," Tyler frowns.

Shutting off the lights on the rest of the world represented a huge risk - one that virtually no other band 

would ever contemplate at the height of their success - but in disappearing from view Iwenty One Pilots felt that when they returned, the only people left would be those who genuinely cared.

"I would be lying if I said there weren't times when Josh and I would speak on the phone and be like, 'Is this a mistake? Has everyone gone?" Tyler chuckles. "We knew that it felt right - we knew that we needed to do it.

We wanted to see who was still here and who was going to stick it out. The people who would still be standing firm and supporting us in the end (would bel our people.

"While we don't know what the timeframe will be in terms of when or even if we decide to take another break, the manner in which we left? We will never do that again."

In their self-inflicted purgatory, the stage was set. Or rather, it was empty, just as it needed to be.

Before the release of Blurryface - an album recorded in studios across the globe alongside multiple producers - there were people in the band's camp who were concerned that some of the early songs didn't quite fit.

When it came to "Stressed Out' in particular - one of the most famous and commercially successful songs of the last decade - there were those who felt it was too odd to make it onto the record at all, let alone be released as a single.

"Certain people were like, 'You can't say Blurryface in a pop song - it doesn't make any sense!' They told me that every word you say within a Top 40 pop format has to be clear, understood and to the point, but I was adamant. I was like, 'You have to trust me - the whole record is about this guy? I thought about that a lot coming into making this album. From pretty early on, 1 knew that the next album/ was going to tell people who Blurface is and where he came from. I needed to show people his agenda.

"The more people learn about him, the more empowered I feel to make sure I'm not compensating for those insecurities and to learn how to fight them." With a goal in mind and a blank canvas on which to paint - one hidden completely from the rest of the world - it was at this point that possibly the most shocking decision of all was made. In complete contrast to its predecessor, this next album would be recorded in one location and produced almost entirely by one person.

The location would be Tyler's basement, and the producer would be Tyler himself.

Fuelled solely by the desire to build on a character that he created and who, at times, it seemed only he and Josh truly understood, he would carry the burden of creating, recording and producing the follow-up to one of the most commercially successful albums of the current century. Except for Mutemath man Paul Meany, who would serve as a sole source of outside collaboration on several tracks, he would largely be going it alone.

It would happen right here, literally under the ground, in Columbus. It would be the biggest battle of his life, and to get through it, he would have to win a war in what would need to become a bunker rather than a basement.

With the decision made, he knew that the only way to come back up would be to first go down.

Down into the basement.

Down into the depths of his mind.

Down into his trench.

In the basement, each day felt longer than any had felt in what seemed like years.

According to the vocalist, his new, self-inflicted reality had pros and cons. On the one hand, it often left him frustrated, which in turn led to feelings of anxiety and discontent. On the other, the pace (or sometimes the lack of) at which he was able to move allowed him to see details more clearly than he had in some time.

He tells me about the days when he would walk down the stairs, knowing he had to make something happen and that he had to find inspiration, only to find not a single note in his head. He also tells me of the beautiful relationship he shares with his wife, Jenna, and the role she played in helping him to unlock the words and sounds that would slowly begin to form the basis of this new chapter.

He speaks of the times when he would hand her the phone while behind the wheel of his car, to enable her to record him humming melodies or reciting poems. These voice notes became ideas that he would chase and in some cases catch, slowly but surely using them to build entire songs over the hours and weeks that followed.

It was in this way that virtually every last detail of the album was crafted, a task that not only required him to provide lyrics and vocals, but also sounds and beats.

With Meany's help, he would spend entire days cutting and editing audio, switching between the once-separate roles of producer and songwriter and sending Josh a series of ideas and passages that the drummer says "just kept getting better and better".

Even when a song was completed, what followed was always the same: darkness.

It was a process that in Tyler's own words almost destroyed [him]", and even from the outside, it's easy to see why. After all, Blurryface was an album the world only sees once a decade at best.

Not since My Chemical Romance released The Black Parade had a body of work - a perfect marriage of sights and sounds that cut to the core of the human psyche - collided on such a mammoth scale.

It was an album that people could believe in, and those who did took it into the deepest corners of their hearts and souls. They donned the paint, the beanies and the backpacks, connecting with it in a manner rarely seen.

It also broke records, becoming the first album in the history of the music industry to see every last song certifed at least Gold, before going Platinum in dozens of countries.

It was a phenomenon, and the shadow it cast was long and imposing. As such, it would have been easy to focus on trying to replicate its success, but to do so would have been a terrible misjudgement. When you create something that big, the best thing to do isn't to attempt to live up to it but to create something completely new, and to remember what it was that got you to that point in the first place.

In my opinion, the best thing anyone could ever do on the back of an album like Blurryface isn't to recreate it, but to leave it exactly where it is.

"I feel like I would have been helped a lot by having this conversation halfway through making this record,"

Tyler smiles. "I think that the notion of having to follow something like Blurryface and knowing what so many people would want to do with that is part of the reason why I wanted to produce this album myself. If this thing fails, then it is a direct representation of what I have to offer [as an artist.

"There's something exciting about that, albeit very frightening. We could have worked with some insane, big-name producers and used the same treatments and formulas [as most other successful artists]. I had never been more aware of how easy it would be to stick to what we know than before I started making this record." After the sounds came the small matter of the story itself. According to Tyler, it's better if people don't know just how long ago the basis for this narrative was formed, and that they don't have its numerous twists, turns and secrets laid bare before most of the world has even heard them. He does, however, reveal that its origins go back further than most will imagine.

It's a story that he says he always intended to tell, although not necessarily through music, and nor necessarily involving the character of Blurryface.

As he continued to feel his way through the darkness of the basement, it became increasingly clear that the two components fit together perfectly.

"It's important to tell people who Blurryface is and where he came from," he insists, "because if he represents insecurity, then I think that the more you know about him, the more jurisdiction you have over what he represents. The more people learn about him, the more empowered I feel to make sure I'm not compensating for my insecurities.

"I feel as though in our minds, there are places that we learn we shouldn't go. There are places where you feel at your best, and there are places where you feel afraid. Your mind is a map. You're [constantly] travelling around and making a note of where is safe and where isn't. That was why I decided that this album was going to be about a place of rules and restrictions - a place with walls."

That place, as we now know, is Dema. A fictional city controlled by nine bishops, it's a place where those who dwell inside its walls are manipulated into never leaving through fear of the unknown.

It's a story told through the videos of three of the songs you're already aware of - Jumpsuit, Nico and the Niners' and "Levitate'- all of which form a story that sees Tyler repeatedly trying to escape, both alone and with the help of Josh and a rebel group of outsiders named the Banditos, only to repeatedly fail.

However, it's outside of Dema where the world and the story truly comes to life. A seemingly never-ending sprawl of freezing valleys and barren land, those who escape Dema must navigate a vast and unforgiving terrain to stand any chance of obtaining a new, better life. Anybody able to escape is furiously pursued by nine bishops - including Blurryface himself - whose sole purposes are to coerce escapees back to whence they came, either by persuasion or, if necessary, by force.

It's a place known as Trench.

Ir's easy to see the parallels between this fantasy world and Tyler's reality. The tireless pursuit of Blurryface; the endless attempts to escape; the maze of underground tunnels that lead from a place that is known to one that is not - it's a story that seems to have its roots planted firmly in the real world.

With that in mind, could the videos we have seen so far give more of a glimpse into the past year than we might initially think?

Take the Banditos on the clifftops in the video for Jumpsuit - could they represent Tyler's loved ones being up above him, in the world outside the basement, while he struggles to find his way through the darkness beneath them?

When Josh leads Tyler through the tunnels of Dema and into Trench in the video for Nico and the Niners' - could it represent the vocalist's journey to Los Angeles, the only place that a note of the album would be recorded outside of the basement, for Josh to track the drums that would adorn the final version of many of the songs?

In the video for 'Levitate', when Tyler is snatched and dragged away by Blurrytace - could it represent the sudden moments of inspiration that would drag him back to the basement, away from the people who care for him the most, in order to escape the shadow of his previous work?

In some ways, you could argue that this new album - one named after its fictional setting - is a story about writing a story. That would merely be speculation on my part, but that I can even ask these questions so sincerely only proves what a stimulating, magnificent and captivating world has been formed.

"For me, every record represents a period of time," Tyler explains. "It's very seasonal. There are a lot of times when I'll write a song, and it's just not one of those seasons. By the time things start to unfold, it's too old.

"There are a lot of songs that don't see the light of day because they simply didn't happen in the right timeframe.

Irs a Way to stay true to who I am as a songwriter, and to reflect who and where I am at any given moment in my life."

As I write these words, only I have heard the album, Trench, in its entirety outside of its creators and their immediate circle. The results are everything that I, you, and the band members themselves could have hoped for. It's vast, varied and meticulous - one of the most ambitious albums you will hear and undoubtedly the best that 2018 will offer, With Josh's drums lending certainty and purpose to Tyler's sweeping soundscapes, there's an intensity but also a sombreness that resonates across its 14 tracks.

As I offer my thoughts on the album, the pride and excitement, as well as the relief spread across the faces of both men, give the impression that its songs are the best they could have offered the world. There are wide grins, loud laughs and, at one point, even a high-five. Particularly when I state that, for all intents and purposes, some of their best moments can be found here.

The soulful, old-school R&B melodies of 'Morph'; the anthemic indie-rock tones of "The Hype'; the stomping beats and the fiery rap passage of Pet Cheetah' - just some of the highlights from an album that gets better with every listen.

There is, however, one song that stands out most.

A piano-driven, borderline spoken word masterpiece,

Neon Gravestones' is one of the best and most important songs that Twenty One Pilots has ever recorded.

In the days between our encounter and submitting this article to print, I thought long and hard about just how much 1 should divulge of its origins, its inspirations and how it came to be. Ultimately, 1 concluded that perhaps it's simply too early to reveal its secrets to the world.

Despite Tyler's blessing, I feel as though it isn't my place to peel back the skin, at least for the time being.

Just know this: it will save at least one person's life. If that comes to pass, every obstacle faced in pursuit of its creation will have been worth it.

"In some ways, this last year has felt like six months, depending on which person I am when you ask me," says Tyler. "I remember six months of cutting audio, editing tracks and being the producer, but I also remember six months of singing and looking for sounds.

"It's strange to be talking to somebody who has heard it, because almost nobody has. The fans haven't heard the whole record, and they still won't even when they first read this [interview).

He pauses and leans forward with his hands clasped together, almost in prayer.

"I just hope that they like it."

Though the wider world may not yet have heard it, it seems unfathomable that those who have stuck around won't find Trench to be worth the wait.

It is a truly stunning body of work - a labour of love that its creators have poured every last ounce of themselves into. A varied and quite spectacular collection of songs, it should see them headline festivals in the United Kingdom and beyond - just as I predicted nearly three ago-and quite possibly take on a stadium or two.

At this stage, nothing is off the table, and with the best part of one million tickets sold for the band's upcoming Bandito Tour, nor should anything be.

Only a few weeks from when these words are first same items of clothing hanging in the living room. printed, arenas across the world will be filled with those Thousands of people in every city will be welcoming a new era, wrapped in the same yellow tape sitting innocently in the living room.

As with every album, and indeed every tour betore it. this new chapter will see Twenty One Pilots rise higher and go further than most would dare to dream.

Then again, they aren't most bands.

"When I first started playing the drums, I had what might seem like an unrealistic goal," admits Josh. "That goal was to do it for the rest of my life. I always craved it, and I was always hungry for it. Meeting Tyler was the first time I felt as though I had met somebody who shared that drive. We very quickly established an agreement, that we would make this band our entire lives.

"I always had faith that something great would happen. Looking back, a lot of the things we wanted to do were probably quite unrealistic, but we didn't have any fear, and we have accomplished a lot. It was and continues to be a lot of work, but it's for something I believe in."

As for Tyler? Well, at least for the time being, he's exactly where I left him more than a year ago.

"I'm in the abyss again," he says with a hint of a smile. "My life is about to change, and that's a hard feeling to describe. It's pretty overwhelming. It can take a day of sitting and staring at nothing to prepare myself. This thing that we're about to embark on, that process of showing you a visual representation of this record, is so important. Even though those two worlds are separate, when they start to bleed into each other it's very special. Yet there's still that sense of being in the dark, not knowing what to expect.

"What people should know about Trench is that it talks about a lot of different places: where I'm from, where I'm going, and the space in between. It's about the feeling you get when you are between where you know you should have left the place where even though you didn't know where you were going, you knew that you needed to get out of and wherever you end up.

"There was a part of me that wanted to define that place on this record, but I don't. After an entire record of songs, you would think that I would be able to get to the end and go, 'And then I found it, and everything was right.' That's just not how it ends.

"It's not about knowing where you're going - it's about knowing you're no longer where you shouldn't have been."

That, in all honesty, is just life. No matter who you are or where you come from, it's a journey packed with uncertainty and fear. It's a series of marathons and sprints of varying distances, and no sooner than you reach the finishing line of one, the starting line of another appears.

The most important part, though, is not how quickly you finish, but simply that you strive to finish it at all.

When you do, those who matter the most will be there to welcome you home.

With that, here are a few welcomes to get you started:

Welcome to a bold, brave and brilliant new era.

Welcome to a place that few could ever dream of, let alone bring to life.

Welcome to the most important album, by the world's most important band.

Welcome to Trench.
