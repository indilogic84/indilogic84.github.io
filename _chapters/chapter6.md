### **Chapter 6: One Year in Trench**

IT's AMAZING HOW often the thing you're looking for is right in front of you.

Whether something as trivial as a wallet or a mobile phone or as profound as your place in the world, as time passes, you begin to realise that the answer is rarely more than a turn of the head away.

More often than not, the things you crave the most are so close that, if you wanted to, you could reach out and touch them. Be it in front, behind or even above you, most people would be surprised at how often the things that matter most have been present all-along.

Thirty feet above the ground on October 17, 2018.

Tyler Joseph was looking for something.

Some 40 minutes before that moment, his bandmate Josh Dun had walked onstage at Chicago's United Center alone while holding a flaming torch, ushering in the second date of Twenty One Pilots'globe troting Bandito Tour in front of more than 15,000 people.

Several hours earlier, I had been given a sneak peek at the world in which the pair would live - one they had meticulously and painstakingly created - for at least the next year. As more than 100 crew members unloaded the 19 trucks required to transport this brave new world from arena to arena, my eyes moved frantically around the room, taking in every speaker, lighting rig and hydraulic platform that I could fix my gaze on.

Near the back of the stage, away from the wheeling of flight cases and the relentless beeping of pump trucks, sat a car. A car which at the beginning of the show would rise from beneath the stage and burst into flames, just seconds after Tyler had leapt from its roof to join his friend in front of the audience.

Towards the back of the main floor was a smaller secondary stage, surrounded by hundreds of tiny lights that moved up and down in perfect tandem.

Then, in the middle of the two, was the bridge.

Suspended from the arena ceiling, its enormous frame immediately stood out as the shining jewel in an already glistening crown. The sheer size of the structure made it impossible to miss, but from the very first glance, it was alluring in a manner that went beyond its mere size.

Intriguing and imposing in equal measure, the bridge has continued to provide the link between the two stages ever since - transporting Tyler and Josh from one end of the arena to the other and forging a starring role in one of the most enthralling live shows you could ever wish to see.

It's a show that, at the time of writing, I have seen 11 times, in seven cities across three countries on two continents, and which has taken place more than a hundred times in front of well over a million people, all in support of their latest album Trench. Their greatest, most challenging and most vital body of work, it's an album that has taken them to every corner of the globe and catapulted them to a level of superstardom that few bands will ever experience, let alone any that happen to occupy such a singular space.

It's seen them inhabit the biggest of rooms and conquer the biggest of stages across dozens of nations, racking up more than 1.5 million sales along the way and solidifying their place as one of the great bands of their time.

So far as journeys go, it's one that surely no other duo will match any time soon.

As Tyler stood above a sea of people in Chicago and paced from one end of the bridge to the other, it felt as though, while his journey was very much in progress, there wasn't yet a clear destination. As I join them in Belgium on a sunny evening in the middle of August, more than ten months on from that night, the direction of travel at least feels a little clearer.

"Over the last year, everything has changed all over again," croaks Tyler. "The shows; the audiences; the size and scale of this world; what these songs mean and how they're presented - we sometimes have to stop and remind ourselves that these things have only happened in the last 12 months. What the songs sound like, what the shows look like and how it all fits together, those are the things that continue to matter the most.

"I think it's easy for people to get caught up in the supposed glamour that comes with things like radio play, chart positions and so on, but what we ve accomplished - what our fans have accomplished and what Trench has accomplished - goes beyond any of those things.

"Maybe a part of that is us reaching because there hasn't been some big hit song on this record, but we have to remind ourselves that we have [still taken so many steps, all of which have been in the direction ve have wanted to go and all of which have occurred in a short space of time.

"More importantly," he adds, "all of which we have taken with our people."

The last time I sat down with the pair face to face in the contert of an interview was in August of last year, in their hometown of Columbus, Ohio.

Surrounded by rails containing all manner of hoodies, jackets and shirts- nearly all of which were a now-familiar tape - I was there to conduct the first extensive interview shade of green and decorated by thick bands of yellow of the entire Trench album cycle. At that moment, the magnitude of where I was and the importance of what surrounded me felt almost overwhelming.

The first person outside of the band's inner circle to be given an up-close look at the garments that would paint the aesthetic of the most anticipated album of 2018, felt as though I was stepping into a new world.

At exactly 1pm local time that day - August 21, 2018 -I turned on my voice recorder for the first time in over a year. Today, on the first floor of one of the most regal hotels in Brussels, I'm here to do it all again.

The time is 7 pm local time, meaning that back in Columbus, it's currently 1pm.

The date on the calendar reads August 21, 2019.

"There's no way!" laughs Tyler, as I point out that, incredibly, it is one year to the minute since our last encounter of this nature.

"Life is so funny sometimes, man. You can make all the plans you want - you can map out everything to a ree and be meticulous in everything you do - but there is a certain symmetry that only the world can conjure.

"I kind of like that. I like [how] sometimes, things seem to work out in an almost perfect way."

"I's cool to be here a year later, looking back on it all and going, 'It worked!'" smiles Josh. "You can be as content or as confident as you like, but until you head out into the world, you don't really know what it is that you have to offer.

"It isn't until then that you know who is going to go with you, who you're going to pick up or what you're going to find along the way."

Several days before we're reunited in Belgium's capital city, Tyler and Josh headlined the country's Pukkelpop Festival - one of Europe's best-known live music gatherings boasting an attendance of over 180,000 across three days. A few days from our meeting, they will be returning to the UK to headline Reading & Leeds, coming good on a prediction made by this particularly smug writer four years earlier.

For these two men in 2019, such mammoth feats are simply a case of saying, "This is what we do?

A year ago, however, their headspace was more about asking themselves, 'Can we do this?

"I remember feeling a quiet confidence about where we were going and about the album that we had made, but i would be lying if I said that there want a nervousness scratching at the surface," recalls Josh. "I remember looking at the schedule for the year ahead and seeing all these huge venues and enormous festivals that were being lined up all over the world, and thinking to myself, 'Man... I hope we can pull this off!

"Everything was so new and different, and I love that, but there is always that fear of the unknown. The thought of being back on a stage in front of our fans and playing these new songs that we had worked so hard on was really exciting, but there is always that tiny (voice) in the back of your mind that asks, 'What if nobody comes? What if people don't feel the same way about this record as we do?

"For the first time in (what felt like) a long time, there was no safety net. If we fell, there was a very real chance that we could get hurt." it's another thing entirely tor people to hear it. That is when fear needs to turn into fearlessness. That day in particular, when you were sitting in tront of us and talking about an album that you had heard - an album that had a release date and a name - that was when it dawned on me that it was time to embrace that fear." When we met in Columbus only a few days after the album's completion, there wasn't much to be found in the way of fear.

Talking with far more energy and excitement than one might expect in such circumstances, the pair were both animated and outwardly enthusiastic about the songs that make up Trench. Eager to discuss the finer details - the flicks and brushstrokes, each sample and subtle nuance - there wasn't so much a confidence as a sense of certainty regarding what they had created.

For a band that was about to follow up one of the biggest and most commercially successful records of our time with an album made in literal darkness, recorded almost exclusively in a basement and based around a fctional city where no one can escape, how they spoke that day was more than a little admirable.

In hindsight - and I mean this in the best way possible - it was downright ballsy.

That's not to say there wasn't just a hint of doubt loitering nearby. One of the most memorable moments of our conversation came when Tyler claimed with a stark and brutal frankness that if Trench were to fail, it would be a direct representation of what he had to offer as an artist.

It was a moment of uncensored honesty not often displayed in front of a tape recorder, and suggested that he was more than aware of the magnitude of the task he had undertaken.

With the exception of Mutemath's Paul Meany, who aided a few of the more technical aspects of the record, the majority of the songs on Trench contain a single writing credit. Contrast this to virtually any album you have ever heard, especially those that occupy the more mainstream spaces, and you will quickly realise that such singular artistry is far from commonplace.

To tackle such a task in the first place is one thing, bur to do so pretty much singlehandedly is bordering on the crazed and the absurd.

"I think it's only since the album came out that I realise the magnitude of that decision, laughs Tyler, after 1 pur it to him that the decision wasn't one that most would describe as normal. "I wanted to get rid of the excuses.

The way that we went about creating this record - the insular and silent nature of everything that accompanied and preceded it - meant that whatever followed was down to nobody but us.

"I think that a lot of people - be they artists, musicians, or songwriters - feel like if they surround themselves with other people and other opinions that they're somehow protecting themselves. It's as though they're creating an environment where if something doesn't turn out the way it's supposed to, or if it doesn't work the way that it's meant to, there are more people to share the blame.

"More often than not, a group of people will find the best version of something," he continues. "They'll find the best hook, the best way to flip something on its head and the best place to cut something out and stick something in. That's fine, but I want people to hear our version of a song. It's a question that I think more people need to ask themselves: would you rather make a perfect song, or would you rather make a song that is entirely yours? That's something I worry about as a music fan. I always ask myself, 'How much do I trust that what this person is singing about is even real?

"I think that with the way music is going - with how it's becoming more and more about hit songs and getting the right track on the right playlist to get the right amount of clicks - it's more important than ever to maintain that sense of honesty.

"At the end of the day, we're not tricking anybody.

There isn't a room full of people behind a curtain. For better or worse, everything you get is us."

On September 12 of last year, it was clear that, in some ways, Twenty One Pilots wasn't only the two of them.

While there might not have been a room of people behind a curtain creating Trench, there was at least a room full of people standing in front of one, waiting to bring it to life.

Almost 15 months after they had last stood on a stage together, Tyler and Josh performed a 60-minute set at London's Brixton Academy, bringing a one-off show to the English capital billed as A Complete Diversion.

In front of more than 5,000 people, it was there that the album took its first steps and made the jump from fantasy to reality.

It was on this day that people got their first look at the car - one that I like to lovingly refer to as The Bandito Wagon - as well as the day that they got their first taste of several new songs in a live setting.

More crucially, it was on this day that the most important people in all of it - the fans - took ownership of the album in a way that has only continued to blossom.

While only a few weeks earlier, I had been standing in a room filled with the same clothes that have since appeared in photos, music videos and on stages all over the world, at the time they were merely outfits. A few hours before the band took to the stage, they became so much more than that. Peering through the window of a cramped stairwell, high above the waiting throng, Tyler and Josh got a first glimpse of their people. It was in this moment that Trench was truly born.

"That was when everything changed - it was one of the most unforgettable moments of my life," smiles Tyler.

"Before that day, it felt a little like we had been dressing up. I would put on the jacket and the tape, and Josh would put on camo of some sort - it was like putting on a costume. When you're putting on a costume, it can feel a little silly. If you're putting on a costume then no matter what that costume is, you can pretty easily feel like nobody is going to take you seriously.

"That day, though, when I caught a glimpse of those people, and I saw them dressed exactly the way we were, it didn't feel like a costurne anymore. It felt as though it genuinely meant something.

"That was the day it felt like a uniform."

It was signiicant in other ways. Until that moment, the pair had spent more than a year speaking a language that only they understood. Bandito; Dema; the significance of the colour yellow - all of them were names and details that held a deep and fercely secret meaning. The two of them had wondered if any of it made sense, or if anybody would bother to speak back to them when the time came.

Even before he first laid eyes on the people lining the streets of south London, Tyler wondered if there would be those who rebelled in the form of colour - choosing to adorn the red and black that represented Blurryface as a way of pledging support to what had been, rather than embracing what was to come. That day, it became clear that the world was ready for change.

"On Blurryface, we would pull up to venues to find a sea of red and black waiting for us," remembers Josh.

"Talways loved that. When I was growing up, that was something I never experienced. I never saw bands with that kind of fanbase, where you could look at people and know who they were waiting for.

"Over the past year, seeing people all over the world wearing green and yellow has been one of the most validating and reassuring journeys of my life. It isn't just because people are on board with what we're trying to create, it's because every time we play a show they're making it clear they're navigating the journey with us."

It's a claim that I can personally attest to. From the bags of yellow flowers and hand-crafted artwork covering a table backstage at Manchester Arena to the parents in Columbus carefully wrapping yellow tape around the limbs of their children, I have witnessed the impact that Trench has had on countless people across the world. I lave been fortunate enough to witnes the songs grow and take on new meaning in rooms thousands of miles apart, as well as having the privilege of seeing almost a dozen shows through the eyes of people separated by vast oceans. People who will likely never meet, but who are bound by a shared wonder.

As the pair navigated their way through Blurryface, their performances grew as they did, and in turn, so did the logistical needs of the live show. Each tour brought bigger rooms and bigger stages, creating a need for constant evolution in how the songs were presented.

Be it bigger screens or bigger lights, no two tours were the same, but prior to Trench they were able to create a show to fit a specific set of rooms.

They might not have known how many people would be there but they did know the dimensions of the smallest stage and the weight limit of the weakest roof, and as such they were able to shape an environment that could live night after night, for however long the world wanted it to.

Although the stage might look the same in almost every city, the true magic of the show is in those who witness it. For all the cars, platforms and giant lighting cubes, human interaction has remained staunchly at its core, and with bigger audiences comes greater strength.

"It's important to balance out the production by simply being present with the people in front of you," says Tyler. "I think that a lot of performers don't work hard enough on simply being there. It's a hard thing to do; it's almost counter-intuitive. Part of being a performer comes in finding a place to go that makes you forget you're standing in front of people who are judging you. You have your cues and your routine that mean you need to walk over here when this happens, or go over there when that happens, and you do need those thineo - but because the pressure of doing it night after night will crush you if you don't have some element of familiarity - but that isn't the most important aspect. What we focus on are the moments - those tiny, real moments of interaction and spontaneity that separate one show from the next. Those moments all come simply from being present. They are what turns the show into this show." There are few better examples of this than something that took place during a show in Glasgow earlier this year. As Tyler stood on top of the crowd during Holding On to You, just as he had done hundreds of times before, he felt something he had never encountered until that night. With his foot gently pressed against the neck of one of the people beneath him, he noticed that he could physically feel the words being screamed back at him through his boot.

A smile spreads across his face as I recount witnessing it today, serving as a reminder that no matter what the band has, or may have in the future in the way of fancy props or elaborate rigs, the heart of Twenty One Pilots - one that has beat harder and faster than ever over the last year - continues to do so in the chests of others.

"It always comes back to the people," admits Tyler.

"The people holding up the drum platforms - the people who I stand on top of and who we reach out and touch as we make our way through the crowd - they are the ones who are at the centre of this thing.

"It's real - it's hazardous and unpredictable. We have no way of knowing what will happen on any given night, and that all comes back to being present. No two shows are the same, because no two audiences are the same."

"Those are the moments that live with you forever," agrees Josh. "You can't rehearse with an audience.

Whether you have done something three times or three hundred times, you can never be sure that it's going to work, but at least you know that whatever happens is [going to be] authentic."

---

From the very beginning, authenticity has been the band's greatest strength, but on Blurryface, it was an attribute that captured the attention of what felt like the entire world: its painfully honest tales of insecurity and self-doubt striking a chord in a unique and universal way.

Its success was stratospheric, both as a body of work and in 'Stressed Out'- a song that for a few months was utterly inescapable on a global level. With standalone single 'Heathens' following hot on its heels, the pair were the sort of commercial bulldozer that record executives can normally only dream of. Given this, one of the greatest triumphs of Trench has been in allowing its creators to become so much more than just a hit record.

That's not to say it has been anything close to a commercial disappointment. At the time of writing, the album has racked up more than 1.5 million sales, which in an increasingly digital age is quite some going. Upon its release, the record topped the charts in multiple countries - Australia, Portugal, Mexico and Spain to name just a few - while almost every major country saw the band record their highest-ever chart entry.

When you consider how mane artists have seen their entire identities swallowed by their biggest successes, the impact that Trench has had is remarkable. The transition from red to yellow has been visible at every show - one that has been seen in the eyes and heard in the voices of every single audience, in every single room and field.

"It's really amazing to hear you say that," smiles Tyler.

"I don't know that a year ago Isuch al transformation was a foregone conclusion. The perspective stayed incredibly zoomed in while writing this record. I don't know if the songs on Trench even know that the songs on Blurryface exist.

"Over the past year, we've been watching these new songs come to life every night. We've been figuring out hoy they all fit together - how they live next to the songs that have been around a little longer. That's more dificult than you might think. You need to uncover the best way to present something for the first time, but you also need to respect what people love about the things that are already living.

"The struggle and the battle to combine these worlds -those are the things we have had to figure out. How do you continue on your way, but still carry pieces of the past without them weighing you down?

"I don't think it will come as too much of a surprise when I say that I think certain people would have liked this record to have been made slightly differently," he adds with a grin. "When you find yourself coming out of a hit record - whatever a hit record means - there are certain expectations. People want you to write a certain song that sounds a certain way; questions are asked about whether you should work with this person or that person. There's a lot of noise. You need to find a way of blocking it out."

"I think there has always been a level of ignorance to how we operate," adds Josh, "right down to how we play our respective instruments. I would be a very different drummer if I had ever had somebody sit down and try to teach me how something should be played.

"That [thought] has always scared me. I think that collectively, as well as individually, Tyler and 1 are always trying to learn and get better, but the fact is that I don't think we have ever worked better than when it's as simple as Tyler sending me a song and me going, That sounds great!'

"I don't feel as though we need anybody critiquing us, or telling us that we're doing something wrong. In the best way possible, I think we have done pretty well just as we are."

Of course, people will always have their own opinions. While Trench might have tossed the rulebook out the window, in terms of what the successor to one of the world's biggest albums is 'supposed' to be, there are still those - the people supposedly 'in the know' - who question their credentials as one of the world's leading contemporary acts.

If you're willing to turn your head ever so slightly away from the people inanely velling at anyone within earshot. however, you will soon notice that Twenty One Pilots is now one of the biggest bands in the world.

With Blurryface, they became the first artist ever to see every song on an album certified at least Gold - a feat they subsequently repeated with its predecessor Vessel.

Think of any band or artist from any period. Elvis; The Beatles; Madonna - Twenty One Pilots did it hrst, yet it still feels as though, for whatever reason, some are unwilling to acknowledge what is in front of them.

You'll often be told that Band A is the biggest band in the world, or that Artist B is the hot new thing, but cover Sure, other bands may be able to headline festivals, take on arenas in the key cities of the Western world and sell a large number of records in their home country, but can they take on 15,000 people a night, every night? Can they go to New Orleans, Lisbon, Stockholm, or any city in almost any nation, and play the biggest venue that it has to offer, night after night? Can they sell out tours months in advance without naming a single support act, and can they fill every last room without giving away tickets under the counter?

Tiventy One Pilots can do all of those things, and for the last year, Tyler and Josh have been doing it relentlessly and on their terms, supporting an album made in a basement and loved by an army of fans who continue to be ignored by everybody apart from each other.

For no good reason, despite their many successes, they remain almost entirely under the radar, despite gazing out from a cloud so high that most other bands can barely make it out.

"I used to think that even when people get to the level we are at and have been at over this past year, they still feel like the underdog, sighs Tyler. "I used to think that it was something everybody felt and that never really went away, but honestly? I just don't think that's the case. I do, however, think the fact that we still go onstage and have to prove ourselves is such a powerful tool. I don't ever want to lose the urge to prove people wrong,"

"As much as the band continues to get bigger, I still get the feeling that a lot of people think of us as their band," Josh adds. "It's like we're still some kind of secret, and I like that. To be at the level we're at and for people to still feel that way about us - for them to feel like we are something they discovered and own a piece of - is really special.

"Sometimes it can be frustrating. It can feel as though no matter what we achieve, there are still people who doubt us, but it almost has to be that way. If we lost that, I don't know that any of this would work. I wonder whether we would still have enough."

'Enough' is an important word. Too often these days, it's a word seen as increasingly defeatist.

Having 'enough'; doing 'enough'; being 'enough'. At some point, a word that by its very definition means to have as much as is necessary became no longer... enough.

What the last year has shown, however, is that Twenty One Pilots do have enough. In a time when perception reigns supreme - when many have stopped believing that opinions are subjective and have started believing that they are in many cases worth as much as facts - the pair form one of the most successful acts in the world.

While the idea of a hit song dominates virtually every agenda, they have shunned thoughts of pandering to any market and instead doubled down on the notion of albums - an actual collection of songs that combine to make a singular body of work - meaning something.

Most of all, they have doubled down on a fanbase that stands behind exactly what it is they are, rather than what other people think they should be. Trench might not have spawned the type of billion-streaming mega-hit that most people spend their entire lives chasing, but what it has succeeded in proving is that big ideas and real stories still matter. It's an album that has taken them to almost every arena in the world, and allowed them to close out festivals on virtually every continent.

If it really matters to you, it's also seen them pick up a number of Gold records, nearly all of which will soon turn into Platinum ones.

Most importantly, and certainly most impressively, it has brought together a fanbase that is here for all the right reasons.

Trench was never about following a hit record: it was about surviving one. They have done that and then some, and they have done it their way, supported exclusively by the people who matter most.

To millions of people, it's more than enough.

I's enough.

It's enough.

"When you make a record, it isn't really until you take those songs around the world and play them to peole that you start to think about how they compare or stack up next to each other," ponders Tyler. "Is it a left turn? Is it a right turn? Is it going backwards?  hope it's going forward. All of those things are in the back of your mind.

"Truthfully, the goal was only ever to write the Perfect record for right now in this very moment. It was always about strengthening our relationship with our fans - this record was written [only] to accomplish that. What the last year has done more than anything is serve as a reminder to ourselves that we can write any type of song, or make any type of record that we want.

It has solidified something and answered any lingering questions that people may have had, as far as what we are capable of or how far this band can go, and what comes next has infinitely more possibilities because of it.

"Some people might feel as though Blurryface is the record that will define us, but I believe that Trench is the anchor that will continue to hold us in place. It is our most important moment - the one that allowed us to finally see exactly where it is we need to go."

---

When you consider that last line, you begin to see that it all comes back to the bridge.

At some point over the last year, many of you will have been to a show and gazed upon it yourselves. You will have been there as it was lowered into view, and you might even have held your breath as. Tyler frantically climbed its staircase. To you and many others like you, it has provided a thrilling spectacle - a feat of engineering that allows those who walk it to move from one side of a room to the other - but what almost all of you will have missed is the reason it grabbed my attention so firmly in the first place. You see, it isn't so much a bridge as it is a space in between two places: where vou've been and where you're going.

In reality, the bridge is Trench.

It's the physical embodiment of a journey between somewhere you know you should no longer be and where it is that you feel you need to get - a metaphor that sums up the journey that Twenty One Pilots has taken over the past year, and will continue to take until whenever it is that the curtain finally comes down on a chapter that its creators have so beautifully written. The meaning and purpose of the bridge goes far beyond a mere spectacle. It is so much more than just a vast prop in a spectacular show.

The steps that Tyler takes - the back-and-forth, will-he-won't-he dilemma that regularly plays out in front of thousands of people - mark the exact moment that he, and by extension Josh, manage to find their way. Every night, the world has been witnessing two people edging closer and closer to where it is they're going, and moving futher and further away from where it is they know they should no longer be.

It's a journey that every single one of us will make at one point or another. You might even make it more than once, and that's okay. The key is simply to keep walking, and to keep searching for your destination.

Because just like I said at the very beginning of this piece, whether it be a phone, a wallet, your place in the world, or maybe even a bridge, the answers you are looking for are nearly always right there in front of you.

Right. There.

"Music doesn't behave the way that everything else does," closes Tyler. "It echoes - it resonates and bounces off of things. It's the source of a million tiny stories being formed at once. At any given moment, somebody somewhere is hearing something we created, and it is having a genuine impact on their day, their month or maybe even their whole life. That is irreplaceable. That is what makes me so grateful that we do what we do.

"It isn't always loud, and it isn't always easy to find, but it's there. It means something, and as long as it continues to mean something, it's going to live forever."
