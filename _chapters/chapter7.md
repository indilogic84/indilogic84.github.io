### **Chapter 7: The Battle for Greatness**

"So... WHAT DO you do?"

It's a question that every human being will face with increasing regularity throughout their life. Depending on your outlook, it's arguably one of the most depressing questions in the world. In a society that increasingly judges people on how they compare to others, and which encourages people to judge themselves most harshly of all, it's one that more and more people are beginning to fear. Yet, ironically, it's one that they will almost certainly continue to ask those they meet.

In March of 2020, when the whole world was starting to ask questions of a different kind, Tyler Joseph was still pondering the most daunting one of all.

"Before that time," he recalls, "if someone were to ask me what I did, my answer was always the same: 'I play shows. I perform music in front of people? Suddenly, for the first time, it felt like the idea of standing in front of an audience could disappear forever. With that came another feeling - a realisation, almost - that I would possibly have to go away and find another identity.

"That was a pretty wild feeling to have, but there was also something strangely calming about the fact that I couldn't do anything about it. It was completely out of my control."

Control has always been a key ingredient of the frontman's success. Alongside friend and Twenty One Pilots bandmate Josh Dun, before 2020, the pair had spent nearly a decade carving out a space as one of music's most singular, not to mention insular entities.

From humble beginnings in their native Ohio to record-breaking global success, the only thing more stunning than their accomplishments is that they've done virtually their terms. Visually, sonically and everything on creatively, they've disrupted and redefined pop culture, despite being frequently told that the way they wished to do things simply wouldn't fly.

All considered, the idea that losing control could ever be seen as calming rather than calamitous feels completely at odds with the methods that got the duo to where they are.

"If I know that I can control something, losing that control is devastating," explains Tyler. "If I get out of shape then that's something 1 can control, but if my hair starts to turn grey or my skin starts to wrinkle then that's something I can't control at all - that's just something that happens. That time feels like something I wish I could have changed, but I couldn't control it."

Nowadays, the events of 2020 feel like a lifetime away. A few days on from the familiar, familial racket of Christmas Day, it marks the first time that I have interviewed Tyler and Josh - albeit separately and via a computer screen - for more than four years. When we last spoke in such formal terms in August of 2019, the two were halfway through the touring cycle for Trench, their then-latest and, to my mind, still-greatest record.

A fearless, peerless masterpiece, it catapulted them from arenas to festival headline status across the globe, with a debut venture into the stadium environment set for the following summer.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic scuppered the closing throes of what was to be their most glorious chapter, it nonetheless presented an unexpected opportunity to start another in the form of their sixth album Scaled And Icy. A far more outwardly colourful and upbeat offering than its dark and gloomy predecessor, the album wouldn't just take Twenty One Pilots back into the world and around much of it but would see them breaking new ground. From entering the world of cinema to standing on the biggest stages on the planet, the last few years have in many ways been some of the band's most successful.

It's in their personal lives that the effects of time are felt most, however. While Josh has since become a married man, having tied the knot to girlfriend Debby Ryan on New Year's Eve of 2019, Tyler has become a father for both the first and second time - he and his wife Jenna welcomed daughters Rosie and Junie in February of 2020 and April of 2022 respectively - with their third child, a boy, scheduled to arrive by the time anyone reads these words.

In the frontman's case, the changes in his life have never felt so monumental, even as he speaks about a period that saw the whole of society shut down.

"I don't know if you ever swim in the ocean," he begins, "but when a wave hits you-"

He stops suddenly. After a few seconds, a mischievous grin spreads across his face.

"Can you hear my daughter crying?" he laughs. "Hold on a second - let me get out of here..."

After carrying his laptop down the hallway, past a smiling Jenna and what appears to be a particularly emotional-looking Junie, he finds refuge from the bedlam and sets himself down - his train of thought derailed in a way that any parent will easily relate to.

"The holidays!"

Order restored, there's no better environment to begin discussing the creation of Scaled And Icy than a silent and empty corner of the very house where the album was born. A house which at the time felt like a corner, in a corner, in a corner - a place that no one could enter but from which sound would eventually learn to escape.

"One of my favourite stories in The Bible is about [the Apostle] Paul," begins Tyler. "In Paul's time, Christianity was a fledgling concept, and he was considered one of the greatest spreaders of The Word. He could get up in front of thousands of people and just talk. At the height of his what I guess you could call effectiveness, he was thrown in jail for [severall years. He just sat there. He began asking God, Why would you do this? I'm trying to move - I'm trying to get out there. Why would you stop me?'

"When I look at that story and how I apply it to my life, I see [2020] as a forced pause. It encourages you to look inside yourself; to fix yourself. Scaled And Icy, for me, was that pause. It was the metaphorical prison that gave me the time to learn about myself.

"Although I don't understand why it happened, what it was for or what the purpose of it was, 1 am different because of it." In a good way?

"In a good way... I think..."

He narrows his eyes and ponders for a moment.

"Yeah," he decides. "A good way."

Having married the love of his life hours before gave way to 2020 while surrounded by his closest friends and family, Josh Dun was looking forward to what he believed would be the best year of his life.

"In a weird way - in retrospect and in terms of my marriage - it kind of was," he admits to me today.

"Throughout the pandemic, I had conversations with friends who have toured in bands for a lot of their adult lives, and they were like, 'Man, it's normally impossible to spend this much time with our pare Looking back, it was a lot of fun. I know that's a weird thing to say about a pandemic, but it was nice to begin our marriage in a completely uninterrupted way."

Marriage was the only way that life was uninterrupted in 2020. After honeymooning in January, Debby travelled to New Orleans in February to begin filming the Netflix vampire-themed thriller Night Teeth, with Josh visiting the set in time for the city to celebrate Mardi Gras at the end of the month. Little did they know, it would be one of the last moments of normality they or anyone else would experience for some time.

"When you hear about a virus spreading overseas, somewhere really far away, it feels foreign," he remembers. "There's this weird feeling that it somehow won't affect you - that it won't get to you.

"One day on set, word got out that Tom Hanks caught Covid. I know it sounds kind of silly, but that was when everyone was like, 'Well, if Tom Hanks can get it, I guess any of us can!' When that happens, that's when you go out and buy every roll of toilet paper that you can find." Travelling back to his then-home in Los Angeles, the drummer visited grocery stores and supermarkets to be confronted with nothing but empty shelves. He describes the sight as something between the final days before the apocalypse and the height of Y2K.

"As things continued evolving, I started watching the news almost every day," he continues. "Suddenly there were daily reports about things like mask mandates, social distancing and quarantine measures.

"That was when it became really scary, and when I knew that things were changing."

Some 2,000 miles away in Columbus, life was changing more than ever for his bandmate. On February 9, 2020, Tyler and Jenna welcomed Rosie Robert Joseph into the world, though they would keep her birth secret for almost two weeks. Her arrival had been carefully planned for, with the band's touring obligations laid out in such a way that Tyler would be present for her birth and her earliest moments. By the time the touring cycle for Trench came to its conclusion towards the end of the year, Rosie would be old enough to join him on the road, getting a first taste of life as the daughter of a travelling musician before the family settled back in Columbus in preparation for whatever came next.

As ever, when it comes to Twenty One Pilots, almost every last detail was laid out perfectly.

"Yeah... that didn't happen," laughs Tyler, looking back on that time. "It's crazy to think about [what was going on] back then, but maybe it was meant to go that way. I've said this before, but I feel like with Josh and I, some sort of door is always closing right behind us, or if not, one opens right in front of us. For some reason, we always scrape by."

The luck that Tyler speaks of has never been more apparent than it is looking back at 2020 from the present day. Sure, the pandemic might have cut short the final furlongs of the Trench touring cycle, but they still managed to break the back of it, headlining enormous festivals such as Reading & Leeds and conquering arena after arena on multiple continents.

More importantly, in the years prior, they had been able to give Blurryface the space and support necessary to turn the band into a global phenomenon. If any album has ever benefitted from a wide-open world, where face-to-face connections and one-to-one experiences are the norm, it was undoubtedly that one.

Had the pandemic hit five years earlier in the spring of 2015 rather than 2020, there is every chance that life would be nowhere near what it is today for its creators.

For a start, would Tyler even be sitting in the house he's speaking to me from today?

"No way," he says, without a moment's hesitation.

"There is no chance that my life would be what it is now. None. Can you imagine if we were trying to pursue this thing - to get this band going - and [a pandemic] happened? Man... it makes you realise how lucky you are when you think about things in those terms. There are probably so many great bands who were just starting out, and who could have really made a mark and impacted the world with their music, but it got ripped away from them. It's so unfair.

"People like us were the lucky ones."

Luck is something that not every member of the Joseph family believes in. Many years ago, Tyler's mother, Kelly, compared watching her son perform onstage to finding a turtle sitting on top of a fence post. It was a metaphor that he initially found confusing, but its meaning is deceprively simple: someone had to have put it there.

In 2020, it was a comment from Kelly that led to the first green shoots of positivity in a bleak and uncertain rime. Having become worn down by the endless bad news spreading as the pandemic continued to take hold, she wished for a distraction in the form of a song - something that could maybe even make her want to dance rather than deliberate.

The response to her wish was Level of Concern'.

A funk-tinged, electro-pop offering purposefully odds with the mood of the outside world, the track rook less than a week to create from start to finish. It quickly stormed up charts and playlists across the world, becoming a feel-good anthem in a feel-bad, feel-scared, or in some cases, feel-nothing time.

More importantly, it paved the way for a new approach to creating music.

"Normally, when we create a song, it'll start with Tyler in his studio, then it'll move somewhere else to add some live instruments like a piano, and then I'll add the drums," explains Josh. "It's a big, live environment in a building filled with producers, engineers, techs and assistants, but when we talked about making music [during the pandemic] it was like, 'This just isn't going to be possible?

"I had a studio in my house in Los Angeles at the time, and I was pretty used to going in there and hitting record, playing something and then deleting it all and re-recording it later. I was like, Why don't I just record something and send it back to you, so you can see whether or not it works?" That's how 'Level of Concern' happened - it was the first song we ever made that way. 

In doing so, we realised we didn't need all that other stuff to make music. We found this new way of working where we could just do it."

"I've said this before," adds Tyler, "but I do feel like with Josh and I, we always seem to figure it out and scrape by. For example, we've always been a band that streams well, but until right around the time we got signed and put out a record, streaming didn't exist on a massive scale. We barely made it, as far as being a band that didn't have to fight far and wide for a position in that culture. We were in the right place at the right time." Though Tyler speaks of doors that always seem to open, one would soon be closing behind him. It was a door that two years earlier had felt heavier than any door he had ever encountered - the one leading to the basement. It was in the basement that he would create Trench - arguably the single-most anticipated album on the planet at that moment - and where he would again have to piece together its successor.

Only this time, solitude and isolation were a rule rather than a choice. Although 'Level of Concern' had seen the art of collaboration no longer defined or dictated by distance, inspiration was another matter. That would again have to come from Tyler's imagination, in a world that felt as unusual and unpredictable as any he had previously created himself.

As with Trench, he would have to begin that journey locked in a room, with nothing but speakers, a rainbow of instruments, and his own thoughts.

Oh... and a tiny plastic dragon named Trash.

When Tyler first began piecing together Trench in the basement almost three years earlier, he did so with the weight of the world sitting on his shoulders.

In the aftermath of Blurryface - an album that will continue to be viewed as a generation-defining moment for years and decades to come - he and Josh had been transformed into borderline celebrities. It was the type of superstardom where their faces were on the sides of buildings, and the people whose faces had been on them previously were suddenly coming to their shows.

Before it came to figuring out how to move on from Blurryface musically, he first needed to establish - or rather re-establish - who and what he wanted to be.

"I've always wanted [us] to be an important band," says Tyler, "but I can confidently say that l've never wanted to be recognised in the process. That was never important to us.

"With Trench, we wanted to take back control." Of how you were seen?

"Of everything."

As any artist fortunate enough to have made a hugely successful album will tell you, when you're making it the rooms are often eerily quiet. It's only after you've released a successful album, when it comes to making its successor, that certain people tend to want to drop by the studio, to be on the phone calls, and to get their fingerprints on as much of the record as possible. With Trench, that was no different. Suddenly, everybody had an opinion.

"When we released Trench, I felt like the message coming back at me was, 'Oh, so you don't want to be a big pop star?'" recalls Tyler. "I feel like a few people were foating around who wanted to coax us into (pursuing) a certain type of career, or to direct us in a way that would have made us more accessible. There were people who wanted to get our faces out there even more, and put us in front of even more people.

"Other bands and artists have been in that position before, where they're thrust into a pop culture arena.

When that happens, people look at you like, 'So... what are you gonna do? You're here now - you can either go this way or that way. You're given these enormous decisions that carry huge consequences, and you're expected to make them in the moment.

"When you're in that moment, it can go one of a few different ways. You can get completely crushed by it; you can bow down to it; you can step up to it - or you can redefine it."

Part of choosing the latter meant pushing people away on all fronts. Having instigated what would turn out to be a year-long period of complete silence, with neither Tyler nor Josh uttering a word in public or on social media, they also chose to keep people at arm's length even when it came to those closest to them.

Despite having their pick of almost any producer in the world at that time and with a virtually unlimited budget at their disposal, choosing to write and record almost the entirety of the album in Tyler's basement, with only the assistance of friend and Mutemath mastermind Paul Meany, remains one of the most risky, daring and defiant moves any artist has made in recent times.

With the power of hindsight, such single-mindedness created another type of isolation.

"Trench was isolated because I felt as though I was fighting to keep people away," Tyler explains. "Everyone was trying to come into the circle - our circle. That sense of fighting and struggle -I feel as though I got that point across to everyone with Trench. When it came to starting work on what would go on to become Scaled And Icy, it was much different, primarily because pandemic aside, there really wasn't anybody trying to work with me anymore. I kind of looked around and went, 'Oh... I guess there are no producers or collaborators out there wanting to work with me now' That's my fault - I created that. I created that expectation in people [that I would want to do everything myself], but still, 1 wasn't about to go and ask anybody to help me."

He delivers that last line with sarcasm and self-deprecation -all too aware of his reluctance to ask for help even when he needs it most.

"Everything about that time - writing Scaled And Icy, piecing it all together - went along with the story I had been trying to tell. It was like I was being held captive, which is how a lot of people felt.

"I started to think to myself, 'Maybe this is just a journal about being trapped.?"

For Josh, the idea of an album being made in an even more introverted manner than ever was hugely appealing, especially given the enjoyable back-and-forth process that had spawned 'Level of Concern'.

"Going into a regular studio is intimidating," he admits. "The whole time we're there, I'm constantly overthinking everything. I'm aware of the money we're 

spending, but I'm also aware of the other people who are there - the people who work there who I'm keeping from going home or being somewhere else.

"Selfishly, being able to walk into my little makeshift studio in my garage to record some stuff and send it to Tyler - it was a lot of fun. The idea of carrying that [process] on while making an album felt completely natural to me."

One crucial element remained wholly unnatural.

Whether it be a walk down the street or a trip to the other side of the world, human beings thrive on their ability to initiate a change of scenery - particularly those whose existence revolves around creating. Neither the notion nor the logistics of making music without help or interference were unfamiliar, but Tyler's ability to design, let alone build without the most basic of freedoms, was virtually untested.

Though the band's biggest and most famous song was inspired by tales of shared childhood - of make-believe stories involving the building of rocket ships and the creation of new identities between siblings - at its core it was ultimately inspired by human beings playing together freely, without fear or restriction.

Even Trench, an album written both in and about crippling isolation, still had its roots planted in the outside world, particularly in terms of where and when inspiration would strike. Be it melodies captured via voice notes or single lines scribbled in notepads, it was an album shaped and affected by the outside world, despite being created while hidden entirely from its view.

This time, though, much of the outside world was no longer there, and with nobody waiting in the wings to help piece things together - no volunteers to co-sign on his fears, if you will - whatever came next would need to be even more singular than ever.

While it may not yet have been clear where he was going or how he was going to get there, as time rolled on, all Tyler knew was that with nobody coming for him, he needed to change his circumstances. Even if it meant doing so alone.

He needed to move, and he needed to move quickly.

Eventually, he realised that he needed to move now.

Right now.

Despite much of the world being closed off, for many people the pandemic was a time of feeling more plugged in and switched on than ever. Be it in the form of turning their bedroom into their office or obsessively searching for answers as to what came next, it was probably the most invasive period in human history. A time when physical isolation led to psychological saturation, and where dividing lines weren't so much blurred as scrubbed out completely.

Having spent an entire decade touring in some capacity, the idea of taking a vacation had always been something that Tyler had found unappealing. By proxy of touring as many days of the year as he didn't - on Blurryface there were more days he wasn't home than those when he was - there was simply no need to get wrapped up in leaving the house or skipping town for a few days.

Furthermore, the ability to write and record songs in buses and hotel rooms across the world provided a near-limitless space for them to breathe. Doors could be opened and shut at will; stresses and struggles stashed away or spread across desks as the mood took. In 2020, that simply wasn't how the world worked, meaning he now had to find ways to create space in an environment designed to provide shelter.

"One of my favourite things about making music is that you don't need your wi-fi to do it," he sighs. "I can be completely off the grid with the click of a button and still be doing my job. There aren't many things in the world that work that way if you think about it. If I wanted to, I could go into the middle of the woods and [my job] wouldn't be affected at all."

Although stranded thousands of miles away, Josh shared the same fondness and enthusiasm for going off grid as his bandmate.

"The feeling when we started moving into actually making Scaled And Icy was a little intense," he remembers. "When the people running society admit that they don't know what's going on, you can start to lose hope that everything is under control. Things changed so many times - it felt as though [the people in charge] didn't know what to do - and that could be difficult to take in. Pretty much every day was a bad news day for a while. When it came to the idea of making music, I was thinking to myself, 'I don't know if a really dark and intense album is what people need right now.""

Despite being separated by a large chunk of the United States, in some ways, the pair managed to collaborate more closely than ever. Utilising everything from Face Time to remote access software, the two could climb inside each other's computers in real-time, sharing ideas and editing tracks as though they were in the same room.

For Tyler, this new way of working stirred something inside of him.

"Something I'm definitely learning more and more as I get older is that the superpower of a creative is in the ignorance of how to create," he says. "As you learn how to create more effectively and get better at navigating that process, you lose a bit of the magic. When it came to making the songs [on Scaled And Icy], I made a conscious decision to chase that feeling. I wanted to get some of that magic back."

As music began to flow, in Tyler's imagination, the basement took on a new form. He describes the feeling as evolving from being trapped in a cell to being stranded on an island - one that had never been landed on before, and that contained an array of interesting thoughts, feelings and tools.

Having taught himself the basics of the bass guitar during the making of Trench, he began to study it on a deeper and more theoretical level. After dabbling with the instrument during the making of "Level of Concern', he also began to teach himself the electric guitar.

Although he agreed with his bandmate that what came next should be at odds with the downbeat mood of the world, the process of learning and the sense of discovery that came with tackling new instruments helped Tyler create more outwardly positive sounds.

"When I first start trying to figure something out, especially in terms of a new instrument, things naturally go a little brighter," he explains. "When I first started 

playing the piano, I don't think I even knew where the minor chords were, which meant that everything sounded bright by default. When you learn a new instrument - at least for me - it's all based around major chords.

Everything sounds happier and shinier.

"An electronic keyboard is a really interesting thing," he continues. "When you press the button for it to play the songs that have been programmed into it, you realise that there are no sad songs in there. The idea of a sad song almost seems forbidden. When I was a teenager, I used to be like, 'This song that I'm making sounds happy and bouncy, so I better counteract that with what I'm talking about.' Lyrically, I could come in and balance the experience, but musically it came out [sounding) that way because I was teaching myself how to play. It was a byproduct of doing it for the first time.

"With Scaled And Icy, there were so many things that I was doing for the first time. I was actively learning how to play the bass guitar [on a theoretical levell for the first time; I was playing the electric guitar for the first time; I was trying to learn how to edit and record drums for the first time. It reminded me a lot of how things used to be." While Tyler wrote and recorded the vast majority of Trench in his basement - or rather his island - he still had support from the likes of the aforementioned Meany, who helped co-produce the album while adding his name to the writing credits of several tracks, as well as putting his fingerprints on the production of 'Level of Concern' However, when it came to the songs that would eventually make up Scaled And Icy, Tyler's desire to do things as independently as possible reached new and distinctly vulnerable heights.

"If I'm totally honest," he reveals, "Scaled And Icy was me deciding to make everybody watch me learn how to produce a record on my own. I wanted the whole world to watch me learn: to make mistakes and to see me being so lobsessed byl the rexture of things that maybe the structures were a little off.

"I wanted that vulnerability."

Far from testing his abilities, what Tyler ultimately wanted was to test his limits, mentally as well as musically. It was here that Trash - the tiny dragon perched next to his studio - would play a starring role.

As he began to piece songs together, Tyler turned to the dragon for inspiration. He developed a theory that even if he was currently confined to one room, in one house and in one town - a corner, in a corner, in a corner - he could still draw inspiration from the tiniest and most singular of details. If he could focus on Trash for long enough, perhaps he would even come to life.

Maybe in time, he would help Tyler to escape.

Truth be told, there was no grand plan when it came to creating Scaled And Icy. Even as songs began to flow, in Tyler's mind there was no guarantee they would even form a complete, let alone coherent album.

"I didn't know if there was anybody left in the world who even wanted to listen to entire records," he admits.

"When I'm done with a song, I like to move it away. I like to put it all the way over to the side, right to the edge of my peripherals, so that I can move on to whatever is next. For me, Scaled And Icy was the most like that of any record I've ever made. There was no plan beyond [chasing] the next idea."

There was certainly no shortage of those. Embracing the topsy-turvy time in which it was forged, each song was entirely its own, driven only by instinct and curiosity. A metaphorical buffet where ice cream and spaghetti could finally live on the same plate, nothing was off-limits. High-tempo funk; new wave; synth-pop; breakbeat-infused electronica; shimmering piano-pop; guitar-driven rock - all were present and none felt the least bit out of place.

As time went on, the speed at which Tyler worked only seemed to increase, pushing him to focus more on exploring ideas than getting hung up on the idea of perfection. For a man so used to overanalysing every note to excruciating detail, it was an important lesson.

"Trench was our moment to go away and build this device," he explains. "It was this thing that we built to help us collect people - to help move us forward - but it maybe forced them to bend to what we felt was good.

With Scaled And Icy, I learned how to become more spontaneous, but I also took the time to look around. It allowed me to figure out how we would be able to move forward again when the time was right.

"I don't want to take anything away from the importance of [Scaled And Icy]," he adds, "but it really is the journey from Trench to the next record."

Genre-hopping aside, Tyler embraced new ways of working, allowing himself to pursue fresh sources of inspiration. Following a request from his musically-minded brother Jay, he allowed his sibling to witness how he creates a song from beginning to end in the form of 'Shy Away'. He even allowed Jay and several of his friends to perform backing vocals on three songs - 'Never Take It', 'Bounce Man' and 'No Chances' while on 'Saturday' he set about writing a song capable of winning the approval of Jenna's disco-loving father.

With Josh on the other end of a new, digital regime that saw him editing and engineering a number of his own drum tracks, the pair assumed more control than ever, with Tyler eventually producing two-thirds of the album singlehandedly. As such, there's an argument that Scaled And Icy currently stands as the purest and most organic Twenty One Pilots album in existence.

"It really was just me and Tyler," says Josh, proudly.

"Tyler produced pretty much everything. He always does a huge amount of the work, but then we'll have someone come in and tighten everything up. This was the first time that he pretty much did everything, bar a couple of tracks, from start to finish. Doing it ourselves allowed for a little more creativity - a little more freedom - and I think you can definitely hear that."

Released on May 21, 2021 - which also happened to be the 21st Friday of the year, because of course it was - Scaled And Icy was met with a sense of surprise on multiple fronts. Visually at odds with the dark, anguished themes of the band's previous works, instead leaning into a bubblegum palette of pinks and blues (with just a hint of yellow not dissimilar to a shade dubbed Happy Daze), the language used to describe the first impressions of fans and critics alike was fairly consistent.

Upbeat; warm; sunny; optimistic; joyful - whatever the word, the verdict was almost universal: this was a poppier, happier Twenty One Pilots that nobody had encountered before.

As Josh explains, though, it's not something he necessarily agrees with.

"The idea of [Scaled And Icy] being an overly lighter or brighter album is one that I've heard a lot, but even when I listen to it today, I don't feel it's that much poppier or shinier than the music we usually make," he counters.

"It still feels like Twenty One Pilots to me.

"If you look at Vessel, you've got songs like 'Screen' or 'House of Gold', and if you look at Blurryface, you've got songs like "Tear in My Heart' and a few more that are a lot lighter to listen to than others.

"Maybe Trench leans a little darker and is a little more sombre than those albums, but to me [Scaled And Icy] doesn't stick out anywhere near as much as some people seem to think."

In Tyler's opinion, much of how the album is viewed from the outside stems from how it begins. A bright and jaunty slice of effervescent piano-pop, when it comes to opening songs, 'Good Day' stands as a beacon of unusually outward positivity in the band's discography.

Parked somewhere between The Beach Boys and Weezer, it's an extremely difficult song to avoid tapping along to: one best described as being more smile-a-minute than mile-a-minute.

Until that is, you realise that its lyrics are describing a scenario in which his wife and children are dead and his bandmate is suing him, leaving him trying to convince himself to carry on living.

It is, unquestionably, the ramblings of a complete and utter lunatic.

"Right?!" he laughs. "So many ridiculous lines in there. The way you describe it - even my inner circle was shocked [by it].

"I've learned a valuable lesson over the years regarding the first track on a record. I's not even chronologically about which song you release or allow people to hear first - it's about which song opens the record. When I saw some of the first reactions to Scaled And Icy and heard what people thought, 1 often thought to myself,

"They're just describing the first song]' That's because the opening track is the lens through which you view the rest of the record. I don't think that I realised that previously. I don't think I understood that."

Opening numbers aside, it doesn't take too much scratching to uncover the album's deceptively dark underbelly. Whether it be the turmoil of feeling responsible for your social isolation, the fear of losing your routine and with it the interest of your spouse, the worry of key relationships shifting and potentially ending, or the never-ending battle to control your own thoughts and emotions, the heartbeat of Scaled And Icy remains as panicked and irregular as ever, from its first palpitation to the last.

Curiously, it's the last song that arguably defines the album as opposed to the first. Inspired by a friend who lost their son to suicide and had subsequently left his room virtually untouched following his passing, 'Redecorate' sees Tyler revisiting a subject that has long since been woven into the very fabric of Twenty One Pilots. Often unspoken; always present.

It was a topic that was literally at the centre of Trench in the form of Neon Gravestones'. Not only was the song planted in the middle of the album as the seventh of its 14 tracks, it was placed purposefully in the middle of the band's set every time it was played in front of an audience. Feel free to check.

With such emphasis came enormous scrutiny, particularly from some of those within their record label. Some even believed the song could legitimately end the band's career, comparing its presence at the heart of Trench to a landmine. As the first person in the world to be granted an audience with Tyler and Josh as a pair prior to the album's release, all anybody in certain corners wanted to know upon my return from Columbus was what, if anything, I would say about it.

This time, there was no pushback. With Tyler knowing early on that the song's rightful place would be at the end of Scaled And Icy, 'Redecorate' provided both stylistic familiarity and a chance for him to get closer than ever to one of life's most delicate and complex issues.

"I feel like [suicide] deserves a certain perspective," he says, carefully. "Topics that are as heavy and as large as that... it's such an important topic. When you zoom in and start talking about the details of it - the logistics of it and what it ultimately entails - that's when it can feel like a new way of approaching it. We're conditioned to view [suicide] through a wide lens, but I wanted to go deeper. It's not pretty -there are details as you look closer that are very uncomfortable - but it can give you a really important perspective, providing you aren't afraid to go there.

"It's just important that you keep yourself tethered to reality, so that you can zoom back out again."

Whatever your preferences, there's no doubt that Scaled And Icy is a source of great pride for Tyler and Josh - a benchmark in personal accomplishment and their joint ability to navigate uncharted waters. Both creatively and circumstantially, it's a record they each feel they needed to make to move forward, as well as being a reaction to what came before it.

As Tyler explains, though, what came before Scaled And Icy it goes far beyond Trench.

"The weight, the effects and the residue of Blurryface are still all around me," he shrugs. "As much as each album is a reaction to the one that came before it, and as much as Scaled And Icy is a reaction to Trench, I feel like every album is ultimately a reaction to Blurryface.

"Whether I like it or not, it's always going to be there."

One thing that was no longer there during the pandemic was an audience. The lifeblood of any artist, in the case of Twenty One Pilots that audience had long been a part of the band - an entity that had physically carried Tyler and Josh during shows and held them safely in its hands.

The blank horizon weighed heavily on Tyler in particular ("I think he genuinely believed that live music might never be coming back," reveals Josh), comparing losing the ability to physically connect with a crowd to a ship losing its anchor.

As the first phases of the pandemic passed and restrictions slowly began to ease, bands and artists alike began to search for new ways to stay afloat. Turning to video streaming, it quickly became the norm for 

bands around the world to shuffle their way into empty venues, performing for paying audiences through largely simplistic multi-camera setups.

While there were a few rare exceptions, the results were often the same and nearly always uninspiring - exercises in financial necessity rather than offering any sort of meaningful, creative expression.

Long before the pandemic, the pair had been resisting the pleas of some to dip their toes into the market, believing that streaming would only dilute the experience of a live show. The earliest examples offered to them in 2020 did little to change their minds.

"At the start of the pandemic, we would see a lot of bands doing streams and playing around with that format," says Josh. "They would be set up on a stage, playing a regular set, and then there would be maybe six or seven camera operators capturing it. I watched a few, as did Tyler, and neither of us exactly loved the idea. I feel like, after a few songs, you kind of get it."

Let's say it: most of them sucked.

"Well..." he smiles, awkwardly. "I definitely held the opinion after watching some of them that if we couldn't do live shows, then we definitely shouldn't do anything that was attempting to replicate one. You can't replicate that feeling [of being at a show], so we were pretty adamant that we weren't going to try.

"As 2020 rolled on, we started to believe that there might genuinely be no way we could tour Scaled And Icy at all. That was when we started asking different questions. Some of our favourite songs and albums were paired with really strong visuals, whether it be a music video or a memory of seeing them live, so the thought of not having anything at all that people could tie to the record felt like such a disappointment.

"In terms of what we produced, it took a really long time, mostly because it was so important that people didn't feel as though we were trying to replace a live show. Whatever we did had to be unlike anything we'd done before."

As the year drew to a close and the songwriting process for Scaled And Icy concluded, with nothing but false dawns and yet more open water ahead of them the pair finally agreed to explore the idea of a stream.

Only, as Josh said, the aim of doing so was not to recreate the relics of a lost world, but rather to expand upon one they had previously created themselves.

Delving back into the Dema storyline that the pair had introduced with Blurryface and taken to incredible new levels on Trench, the event would not be so much a concert as their take on a musical - an experience as opposed to a mere stream. With the album's title doubling as an anagram for 'Clancy is dead', the event provided a perfect opportunity to connect people to a familiar narrative while getting used to unfamiliar sounds. From frozen tundras to urban streetscapes, each set was meticulously pored over for more than six months and packed full of incredible detail - each scene carefully filled with Easter eggs and hidden messages designed to engage people like never before.

Under the stewardship of director Jason Zada and the band's in-house team headed up by longtime content director Mark Eshleman, the event was broadcast live to a global audience on the day Scaled And Icy was released. Filmed at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus after days and days of meticulous rehearsals and pre-production, the performance - known as the Twenty One Pilots Livestream Experience - set a new standard for the format.

Aesthetics aside, the performance breathed fresh life into songs old and new. Featuring an array of dancers and backing vocalists, as well as introducing people to a live backing band, it pushed both men to new limits in the most unforgiving of environments - one where any mistake would be magnified and broadcast to the world in agonising detail. From choreographed dance routines to countless set and costume changes - all of which needed to be timed to perfection amid numerous cutaways and story-led interludes - it ranks as one of the most challenging not to mention financially-hazardous risks the duo has ever taken.

Most crucially of all, it allowed them to be back onstage together for the first time in almost 18 months, giving both men hope that things may eventually return to some semblance of normality.

"When I'm playing a show, it feels like that's what I'm supposed to be doing," says Josh. "I need that [feeling].

When I was a kid, I was homeschooled until the fourth grade, and I didn't like it. It was kind of a free-for-all. A lot of kids would probably enjoy it, but I didn't. My Mom would say to me, 'You can get up whenever you want and we'll get everything done - it'l be fine? Eventually I was like, 'Can I please just go to school?" I wanted to get up when all the other kids did - to get on the bus and have that same routine.

"I craved that structure. Despite the pandemic flipping the world on its head, that craving never went away."

For Tyler, the first taste of a world where live music could once again exist was particularly vital.

"Everything [that we do] comes back to the live and touring aspect. Without it, we simply don't have anything to hold us in place. To his credit, our manager Chris (Woltman] was the one who said, We're not going to let this be viewed as just a pandemic record.' He pushed everything to the point that we were not only able to think about performing again, but we were able to start believing that we might be able to stand in front of an audience again."

---

Just a few weeks after the stream took place, the thought of standing in front of an audience started to become a reality. After multiple false dawns over the previous 12 months, in June of 2021 the pair announced their first tour in almost two years, the Takeover Tour. Following a similar format to their Tour De Columbus jaunt in 2017, the tour would see them take up residency in five American cities - Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta - between September and November of that year, playing four shows in each, ranging from tiny clubs to large arenas.

With a three-night stint at the Nationwide Arena in their hometown tucked in the middle and a huge open-air show in Mexico City bookending the run days before Thanksgiving, the two would finally be reunited with the experience of being in front of an audience. It was a surreal feeling that both men had been aching for.

Really aching.

"I definitely started to feel [my age) on that tour,"

Tyler laughs. "It's the legs - it's all in the legs! I can work my butt off all day, like when I go into a studio and spend hours and hours chipping away at whatever time there is between then and the next idea, and I can balance it with family life and the responsibilities that I have alongside that, but I've still got to take care of my body. More now than ever."

Before they could head back into the world, there was first the small matter of home to attend to. Although their first show back would be several hundred miles away in Milwaukee, as part of the Summerfest concert series a few days earlier, in September of 2021 the pair returned to Columbus for a one-off performance at the city's Newport Music Hall. As most already know, it was the building in which Tyler and Josh first met, as well as the venue that hosted arguably their most pivotal show in 2011 - a show that turned them from local heroes to one of the most sought-after unsigned bands in America.

It might not have been the hometown comeback they would have preferred it to be, but by the time their Newport performance drew towards its familiar conclusion, moments before the opening notes of "Trees' would ring out from Tyler's keyboard, it at least felt right.

"There were several times during that break when we didn't play shows..." Tyler began, as the audience fell silent. "Josh and I would be on the phone, and I'd tell him, 'I don't think it's ever happening again', and I meant it. I really thought that was a different life and that there was no way we'd ever get back in front of people, playing shows.

"To go from that mindset to being in our hometown, in one of our favourite venues in the entire world..." In unison, virtually every person in the room erupted - Tyler's thoughts completely derailed as the weight of the moment suddenly hit him. As he steadied himself, he said the only words he could now think of:

"Thank you for sticking around."

It wasn't just their hometown fans who had stuck around. Within minutes of going on sale, almost every North American ticket for the Takeover Tour had been sold, as well as the 19,000 tickets for the tour's lone overseas residency in London, scheduled to take place around a handful of European festival appearances.

Tyler describes the tour as a crazy and uncomfortable venture - a deeply stressful and uncertain experience that I would never want to go through again," he admits - and when you consider the realities of what goes into putting a tour on the road, it's easy to understand why he would feel that way.

Even in so-called normal times, the costs associated with touring can be enough to make your nose bleed. Flights; buses; hotels; crew; merchandise; sound equipment; lighting equipment; stage rigging; venue hire; insurance - these are just some of the costs associated with putting on a show that never stop even on your days off. In the middle of a pandemic, one outbreak in the travelling party or one surge in cases in a city on the schedule can spell disaster.

However, for all its hazards, Tyler sees the tour not as something that he and Josh chose to do, but rather something they had to do.

"Everyone knew that there would be risks involved in touring during that time, both in terms of the people going to the show and the people putting it on, but we needed to communicate with our fans," he stresses.

"We needed to be smart about it, obviously, but it was important for Josh and I to show people that even when things get tough, we're still willing to take a risk for them.

We wanted to show up - to give them an opportunity to see us and to show that we were in it with them - and I'm so glad that we did.

"I think that Scaled And Icy would live very differently in people's heads if we hadn't toured it at all. It would have felt as though we didn't believe in the record if we didn't co-sign it, and doing that meant taking it to people.

To me, it's two records: the record that we released for people to listen to and the record that we performed in front of them."

Exactly how the record was performed in front of people is where one of the biggest changes of the Scaled And Icy era can be seen. Throughout both the Takeover Tour and its eventual follow-up run The Icy Tour a year later, for the first time since Tyler and Josh began playing together more than a decade previous, Twenty One Pilots would be presented as more than just two people.

At least to a point.

Although each show would begin and end with the two of them onstage alone, four others would join them throughout the performance - bassist Sky Acord, guitarist Dan Geraghty and multi-instrumentalists Todd Gummerman and Jesse Blum - all assembled under the watchful eye of Meany, who despite stepping back from much of the production duties for Scaled And Icy now served as the band's musical director.

The addition of a touring band was a genuinely huge call. The first time I ever sat down with them, Tyler and Josh were incredibly honest about the fear they felt when considering adding other people into the mix. They spoke of their pride in doing things alone, as well as the dangers they felt that making such a change could present.

That was then, though, and in the years following that conversation, the duo climbed pretty much as high as any two-piece could. The ceiling may have been high - so high that it would have remained out of grasp for virtually any other pair in their position - but it was nonetheless one that they had become able to reach out and touch. In any such situation, people's instinct will nearly always be to try and break through it.

"[Playing with other people] was something I had always wondered about, even though it was something we had always shied away from," offers Tyler. "With adding people to the shows, yeah, I think there was maybe a part of me that had always wanted to be in a band in a more traditional sense - or at least to know what that felt like - but it was first and foremost about making a better show. I wasn't craving to enjoy myself more onstage or anything like that - I was never striving to have a better time. It was only ever about the end product and the experience that it gave others.

"Was it a better show? I don't know that I know the answer to that, honestly. As you talk to me now, I don't even know what the future looks like in terms of how anything is presented live [as we begin to start] moving forward, but Scaled And Icy was a very valuable lesson for me when it came to that side of things. At that time and in that moment, I needed to do it."

As Josh reminds me, Twenty One Pilots being a two-piece was always somewhat of a mistake.

"I remember the first time Tyler and I played [as a two-piece]. When I originally joined the band, the old bass player [Nick Thomas] was still in the group. He couldn't make it to a show we had booked, so we set all of the gear up downstage - just me and Tyler - and played the show. Just the two of us, purely because we didn't want to cancel. I remember that feeling, looking at each other and going, 'This is what it needs to be.'

"I do feel as though in his mind and heart, Tyler has always been curious about experiencing being in a band with a group of people. I feel like we've been at festivals in the past, or watching the opening band on one of our own tours, he's had this feeling inside of him that was like, 'I want to know what that feels like.'"

Was there a nervousness about making such a big change to the band's DNA?

"I always took a lot of joy in the fact that it was [only] two of us," he admits. "In the past, we would get done playing a show and someone would come up to me and be like, 'That was such a great show! I can't believe that only two guys are doing it!' I always really liked that.

"The band is still just me and Tyler - that hasn't changed. There's a pride that I have in this just being the two of us, but if there's something that can be gained or elevated in terms of how the songs come across live, and if that comes from having other people performing with us... it felt like the right time to do it.

"I will say that I had a lot of fun playing with those guys, and I do think it created a new and unique Twenty One Pilots experience."

Though Tyler may have described Scaled And Icy as two different records, the last several years have equally seen the emergence of two very different people.

Particularly in terms of himself, the ways in which he differs from the person he was last time we sat down for an interview are almost too plentiful to list. He's calmer, speaking with a confidence and assertiveness that wasn't always present in the past, giving the impression of a man more assured of where he wants to go. He goes to bed at night and wakes up in the morning (most of the time), and he channels his creativity in a more structured way, creating timetables rather than being on call 24/7.

Unsurprisingly, he's a man with very different priorities: those of a father. In the months after Rosie was born, he described fatherhood as one of the only things in his life, if not the only thing in his life, in which his enthusiasm only ever increased as opposed to hitting a comfortable plateau.

While the effect that becoming a father has had on him is obvious, I've long wondered what impact it may also have had on the band. The dancing; the costumes; the bright colours; the happy sounds; the big blue dragon - there's an almost cartoonish quality to many aspects of Scaled And Icy. Sure, there's a darker and more sinister side lurking in the background, but to pick up on those things requires a level of cognition that no toddler realistically possesses.

With that in mind, I ask Tyler whether there was a part of him that wanted to create an album that would be accessible for Rosie - an album that she could experience and enjoy, and that wouldn't be too dark or scary for her to be exposed to.

"I don't know if that was necessarily conscious," he ponders. "I think that looking back..."

Suddenly, a switch flips.

"Rosie hasn't been at many of our shows. She's only really been to a couple, but when she's there I am very aware that she is - I can feel her there. I'll start saying things to myself like, 'Maybe don't do that weird thing; maybe don't say that silly thing you were going to say.?

I don't know... it's weird. I expressed those feelings to Jenna at the last show we played where Rosie was watching. I was like, I'm not sure how comfortable I am with my family being at a show.' Maybe I just need to work through it and get over it, but there's something about my child, about my daughter..."

Another flip.

"I want to introduce her to these themes at the right time, and in the right order. What will happen if she continues to watch me perform is that she's going to have to learn to separate the person she sees onstage from her dad. She's going to have to - there's no way around it. I don't know if I want her to have to do that. I don't know that I'm comfortable with her seeing me as two different people. I don't like [my kids watching me play a show], and that sucks. That's something you would think you'd want your kids to see and enjoy like everybody else." It's an incredibly raw and unguarded moment of honesty, and it's these kinds of moments that I've long since found the most interesting. Although the stories and characters that Tyler and Josh have created in tandem with

their music have captured the minds and imaginations of so many people, it's a subject I've never wanted to pursue too relentlessly. Not because it doesn't interest or fascinate me, but because to attempt to educate the band's most invested supporters on any aspect of their world would feel like explaining how a clutch works to a stunt driver. Any secrets I may know are not mine to tell, and any conclusions I draw will never be the most detailed or succinct compared to those of their fans.

What I've always found the most fascinating is the human story at play - the thoughts and perspectives of two ordinary people who happen to be capable of truly extraordinary things.

In an age of constant scrutiny driven by demands of perfection and instant gratification, it's far too easy to forget that the people we see on posters, in videos or on a stage are, at their core, as normal as the rest of us.

It's a difficult line to walk, even for Tyler himself

"I feel like a lot of the people I know and love put the Tyler who performs onstage in a closet somewhere," he continues. "It's like they let him out to do his thing and then put him away again. Even directly after a show - even in the way that you and I interact - I think you more than anyone, you're wanting to interact with the guy you saw onstage because you have so many questions for him, but no one else wants to interact with that guy.

They just want him to be carried away and to be put into the truck with all the lighting. I don't think that Rosie knows how to do that.

"To come back to your original question, about whether or not any aspect of [Scaled And Icy] was made for her, I guess that maybe I was trying to create a world for me to be creative in, but that also allowed me to carry on the story in a way she could interpret. It wasn't intentional, but maybe it was there, subliminally."

Whatever the source of its inspiration, on a purely creative level, Scaled And Icy provided Tyler and Josh with a new and vast array of tools with which they can continue to move forward. Technical and logistical lessons aside, it pushed them into completely new territories they would never previously have dreamed of going near.

Almost a year to the day after its initial broadcast, the pair took their Twenty One Pilots Livestream Experience into cinemas across the world. Featuring additional behind-the-scenes footage and enhanced audio tailor-made for the big screen, the event was shown in more than 2,000 cinemas in over 70 countries. One week before the film's release, they recorded a special set for the legendary MTV Unplugged series in Los Angeles, containing reworked and reimagined versions of numerous songs from across their back catalogue and performed live in front of a studio audience.

Embarking on both challenges, let alone within days of each other, was a mammoth task, but in tackling them head-on the pair showed themselves, as well as the rest of the world, that they could rise to virtually any occasion.

Or, as Josh puts it, "that [they] can pivot and change course, even if it means tearing up [their] plans".

Perhaps the best example of that ability came in February of 2023. Following the last-minute cancellation of Blink-182, Tyler and Josh were approached by promoters in South America to fill the vacant headline spot at a handful of festivals across the continent, including Lollapalooza.

Despite having barely two weeks notice to pull everything together, including assembling a makeshift crew, they stepped out of their comfort zone like never before to perform in front of crowds regularly consisting of more than 100,000 people. It was a landmark achievement - one that saw them erase any remaining scepticism as to whether or not they have a place in the top tier of contemporary touring artists.

While some have never seemed to grasp the size and scale of the band, you'd be hard-pressed to find bigger critics of Twenty One Pilots than its own two members.

Tyler in particular has always cut the figure of somebody striving for more; to be seen as successful as well as being successful. It's an insecurity likely driven by a case of imposter syndrome that so many of us have.

As I put it to him, it's surely getting to the point where even he must see the band for the success that it is. After all, what challenge outside of playing a set on the Moon are they yet to tackle?

"You're right," he concedes, with a reluctant smile.

"You're completely right. It still feels like our little secret, though. Maybe it's not - maybe it's a lot bigger than that.

"It's almost impossible to maintain a perspective of what you're doing when you're the person inside of it," he adds. "I think there's a real value in having just a few people in your life who you feel can be honest with you, and that's something I learned through the process of making Scaled And Icy. I needed to let those people know [about my struggles]; to allow myself to ask them to speak up.

"On the next record, I've been able to bring people like Chris [Woltman] and Mark [Eshleman] out to my studio of despair during that process when I was wondering whether I could get the record done, and I was able to show them how I really feel when I'm in the studio. It was a moment of complete uncertainty that I so often live with, and it was heavy. People were allowed to see a moment that I usually reserve for myself. They were asking themselves, Does this guy think that anything he does is good?'

"I know I'm jumping ahead, but thinking back to Scaled And Icy, I didn't show my cards. I didn't show anyone how I was kind of being tortured while creating it, despite the perceived freedom I had. I feel like I've learned that it's okay to show people every once in a while - it's okay to let people see the turmoil. I always thought I should keep that to myself, and I can definitely feel that [on Scaled And Icy] when I listen to it. I can feel that I didn't allow anyone to know just how hard it was on me, and that's something I purposefully changed in terms of what comes next."

As he speaks, you can see the tension leaving him.

"I'll tell you what, man... it's better for it."

Despite the time that has passed since our last interview and the vast array of personal and societal changes that have occurred in that period, it's clear as our conversation draws to a close that despite the various successes that played out over the course of Scaled And Icy, and despite the countless bridges that were crossed in the process, one thing simply hasn't gone away: the doubt.

As strange as it might seem, there's still a genuine uncertainty - a very real fear and anxiety - at the heart of one of the biggest and most commercially successful bands of the last decade. Feelings that make its driving forces question whether or not they're any good at what they do, as well as whether they're remotely worthy of their position.

Even after years of glittering success, billions of streams and the millions of fans who have witnessed them conquer the globe, the two people at the centre of it all are still riddled with many of the same fears and insecurities they were on the day we met.

To revisit something I wrote five years ago: it's as though they still don't believe that what they have to offer is enough.

"It's funny," begins Tyler, "sometimes I turn to [my wife] and I go, 'You know... I could've been great.'"

To hear these words come out of his mouth is a genuinely jaw-dropping moment.

You don't think you're great?

"No," he replies, bluntly. "I guess that, like, in terms of fame or success, all that stuff..."

He hesitates, unsure as to whether he should go where it is that he clearly wants to.

"I’ve never met him, but a few years back [legendary producer and songwriter] Max Martin reached out and was like, TIl fly to Columbus - let's make a record together!' That was the moment. He's one of the best songwriters in the world; a guy who understands writing a song like nobody else. I was like, 'Do I take this moment? Is this my moment?'" never met him, but a few years back [legendary producer and songwriter] Max Martin reached out and was like, TIl fly to Columbus - let's make a record together!' That was the moment. He's one of the best songwriters in the world; a guy who understands writing a song like nobody else. I was like, 'Do I take this moment? Is this my moment?'"

He then scoffs, almost apologetically.

"For whatever reason, I chose to go my own way and write a record like Scaled And Icy instead."

The truth, even if they don't always see it themselves, is that what Tyler and Josh have achieved is incredible.

Although I live thousands of miles away on a different continent, I see and feel the impact that the band has had almost every day.

For the last several years, I have heard my neighbours playing their music through the walls that separate us almost every day, just as I've witnessed the children of my friends and family grow older and begin to wear shirts, hoodies and hats bearing their name.

Recently, I even discovered that an assistant at my dental practice has been a fan of the band for as long as I've been writing about them. Given I live in a house in a small town, near a small city on the other side of the world from the pair - my own corner, in a corner, in a corner - moments such as those have a way of putting things into perspective.

They might not always feel it or even be aware of it, but the impact of the band is pretty significant.

Or, as I put it to Tyler, pretty great.

"Wow..." he smiles. "You know, I really appreciate that. Hearing things like that... it's so humbling.

Sometimes I need those reminders that this thing is so much bigger than [my own feelings]. Whenever I interact with someone or whenever someone recognises me, they're often like, 'You're just... walking around!

It's like nobody knows it's you!' I love that. I'm always like, 'Nobody knows - it's just me and you! This is our secret!' As our fans get older and find themselves out in the world, getting on with life, it's really special to have those moments.

"One of the last interactions I had [with a fan] was at a clothing exposition, where I met a woman who has her own business selling vintage T-shirts. She came up to me and told me how much she appreciated what Josh and I have created. I was like, 'You're a boss! You've got your own business; you're driven; you're super-smart - I want to learn about you!'

"It's so amazing to see some of our fans getting older and pursuing their goals, while still living inside that bubble of being a Twenty One Pilots fan.

"It's a really cool place to be."

As usual, it's a place that is also entirely their own. It might not have been created or presented how or when they might ideally have wished - just as it might not have sounded the way that some people wanted it to - but what's undeniable is that Scaled And Icy has become one of Twenty One Pilots' biggest accomplishments, and it's what the album represents rather than what it simply sounds like that makes it so.

It's an album about learning - or at least trying to learn - to let go.

It's about embracing a side of life, as well as a side of yourself, that you aren't necessarily sure of.

It's about learning to be comfortable with your discomfort and making peace with the things that you can't control, no matter how much you wish that you could, as well as being satisfied with the things you can.

Most of all, it's about knowing who you are in any given moment, however that may compare to who you were, or who you will ultimately become.

To go back to the question posed at the beginning of this chapter, it's about being able to answer it with five very simple words:

"Anything I want to do."

Well... almost anything.

"I don't know that Tyler and I will ever be at a place in our career where we're like, It's all fine now - people are always going to come to the shows and listen to our albums, and it's all going to be okay,'" says Josh. "We still have this feeling that it could go away at any time."

Seriously? Do you still believe that?

"Absolutely. We're finishing a new album now, and we're going to play some shows in the near future, but I still envision walking out onstage and nobody being there. I don't know what that is, and I don't know if it will ever go away at this point. I do feel as though the more albums we release, the more times that we go away and the more times that we come back to find people there, the more it does allow me to feel a little more comfortable, but it's still in the back of my mind that it's only a matter of time until people don't care anymore." Having ended the cycle for Scaled And Icy standing on the biggest stages in the world and in front of the biggest audiences of their career, the thought of everything and everyone suddenly disappearing feels hugely unlikely.

That said, it's a feeling that's completely in step with anything the two have ever said to me, going back to our first encounter.

It was during that meeting - documented in the very first chapter of this book - that Tyler spoke of the disappointment he felt when watching artists going through the motions. Artists who were no longer grappling with something that had once consumed them night after night.

Almost a decade on, in a world so vastly different to the one that first brought us together, as we prepare to part ways, I wonder what it is that he's grappling with these days, as well as how those tussles might shape whatever comes next.

What, exactly, is he fighting?

"I know that this might sound a little over the top," he cautions, "but I really do believe that when I'm onstage I'm fighting for who I am. I'm fighting for my identity - for my purpose and what it is that I stand for.

"I don't think that our career was ever set up in a way that allowed for any sort of victory lap," he continues.

"Things just never panned out that way. We probably could have taken that lap at some point, but we always decided not to. There have been opportunities for us to celebrate, or to cash in and kind of coast on our legacy, but that time has passed us by. I'm glad [that it has], because now the only option is to get onstage again." Suddenly, a familiar glint appears in his eye.

"It's going to be a battle - it's going to be a fight - and that's exactly what it needs to be."
