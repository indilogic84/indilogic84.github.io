### **Afterword**

For pretty much as long as I can remember, I've spent a lot of time trying to understand myself.

As a songwriter, you naturally find yourself looking inward. You're constantly probing and self-evaluating, and that aspect of my personality has become a big, often all-consuming part of my life. However, it isn't until you talk to someone, particularly someone you know and trust, that you can really begin to cut to the core of your own identity.

When Josh and I started out, the notion of being interviewed by someone, least of all a complete stranger, wasn't even on our radar. We pictured what we wanted our shows to feel like, how we wanted our relationship with our fans to be, and thought about the energy and level of commitment that we would each bring to the project. We never grasped that there would be other ways for us to communicate with people, or that we could build relationships with others who could help us tell our story.

Sharing our innermost thoughts and feelings wasn't always easy. Truth be told, that vulnerability can still be challenging. I remember when I first realised that somebody could talk to us and walk away feeling negatively about our exchange. At that point, my first reaction was to feel as though I didn't want to talk to anyone. I couldn't understand why I would take that kind of risk, but over time, I began to see that there was a value in other people speaking for us.

So long as they were the *right* people.

Honestly, that's how I would describe Ryan. In meeting him, we found someone worth having on our team - someone who could bring a perspective to this thing that we couldn't have communicated as clearly or concisely on our own. A lot of people have the ability to judge music technically, but not everyone can judge it emotionally. The things that I sing about are drawn from a singular source - they are not and will never be created by committee - and the music has always been honest as a result. Often painfully so. Our music is a direct representation of who we are as people.

It's a lot easier to critique somebody or find flaws in what they do than it is to connect with them as an individual, but Ryan has never been that way. It means a lot to have people like him in our corner - people who know who we are and have been there for a really long time - and who would step up for us if we ever needed. We talk to him because he wants to talk to us.

Ultimately, we share an understanding of the value of storytelling. Having a story to tell... it keeps your life in order. The identities Josh and I have as individuals don't come solely from being in a band called Twenty One Pilots, nor do they come purely from our fans and the connection we share with them. They come from a story we're telling that lives inside of those things - inside of those songs, inside of those relationships - and that story allows us to find ourselves as much as it allows others to do the same.

In the beginning, telling stories was something we simply enjoyed doing, but it's become so much bigger that that. It defines who we are. As time goes on, our appreciation for those stories and the people who helped us to share them with the world only continues to grow.

I would imagine that most of you reading these words already consider yourselves to be fans of Twenty One Pilots, but even so, I hope that after reading this book you feel as though you know us even better - on an even deeper level than you previously knew us - and that these stories continue to mean as much to you as they do to us.
